In extant insects, the <u>prothorax</u>  never has wings, though legs are always present in adults; wings (when present) are restricted to at least the mesothorax, and typically also the metathorax, though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments (as in the fly shown, where the metathoracic wings have been reduced to tiny balancing organs called  halteres). In the  Apocritan Hymenoptera, the first abdominal <u>segment</u>  is fused to the metathorax, where it forms a structure known as the  propodeum. Accordingly, in these insects, the functional thorax is composed of four segments, and is therefore typically called the  mesosoma to distinguish it from the "thorax" of other insects.Each thoracic segment in insects is further subdivided into various parts, the most significant of which are the <u>dorsal</u>  portion (the  notum), the lateral portion (the  pleuron; one on each side), and the ventral portion (the  sternum). In some insects, each of these parts is composed of one to several independent exoskeletal plates with <u>membrane</u>  between them (called  sclerites), though in many cases the sclerites are fused to various degrees.</td>

The same economic pressures which increased sizes to the point of carrying four or five masts, also introduced the <u>fore</u>  and aft rig to larger vessels, so few ship-rigged vessels were built with more than three masts.

The Equal Protection Clause can be seen as an attempt to secure the promise of the United States' professed commitment to the proposition that " all men are created equal" by empowering the judicary to enforce that principle against the states.More concretely, the Equal Protection Clause, along with the <u>rest</u>  of the Fourteenth Amendment, marked a great shift in American constitutionalism. Before the <u>enactment</u>  of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bill of Rights protected individual rights only from invasion by the  federal government. After the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted, the Constitution also protected rights from abridgement by state governments, even including some rights that arguably were not protected from <u>abridgement</u>  by the federal government. <mark>In the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment, the states could not, among other things, deprive people of the equal <u>protection</u>  of the laws.</mark> What exactly such a requirement means, of course, has been the subject of great debate; and the story of the Equal Protection Clause is the gradual <u>explication</u>  of its meaning.For a long while after the Clause became a part of the Constitution, it was interpreted relatively narrowly. During and after World War II, however, the  United States Supreme Court began to construe the Clause more expansively. During the 1960s, the other two branches of the federal <u>government</u>  — the  executive and the  legislative — joined in, as  Congress and the President passed and enforced legislation intended to ensure  equality in education, employment,  housing,  lodging, and government benefits. While an expansive <u>reading</u>  of the Clause was undercut, to some extent, by Court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, the Equal Protection Clause remains an integral part of  U.S. constitutional law.</td>

Salt is involved in regulating the <u>water</u>  content (fluid balance) of the body. Salt  <u>flavor</u>  is one of the  basic tastes. Salt cravings may be caused by trace mineral deficiencies as well as by a deficiency of <u>sodium</u>  chloride itself.Salt is required for life, but overconsumption can increase the risk of health problems, including  high blood pressure, in those individuals who are genetically predisposed to hypertension. In food preparation, salt is used as a  <u>preservative</u>  and as a  seasoning.</td>

      <td>The <u>thorax</u>  is a division of an animal's body that lies between the  head and the  abdomen.In humans, the thorax is the region of the  chest formed by the  sternum, the thoracic  vertebrae and the  ribs. It extends from the  <u>neck</u>  to the  diaphragm, not including the  upper limbs. The  <u>heart</u>  and the  lungs reside in the  thoracic cavity, as well as many  blood vessels. The inner organs are protected by the  <u>rib</u>  cage and the sternum.In insects and the extinct  trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions (or  tagmata) of the creature's body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments. It is the <u>area</u>  where the  wings and legs attach in insects, or an area of multiple articulating plates in trilobites. In most insects, the <u>thorax</u>  itself is composed of three segments; the  prothorax, the  mesothorax, and the  metathorax. In extant insects, the <u>prothorax</u>  never has wings, though legs are always present in adults; wings (when present) are restricted to at least the mesothorax, and typically also the metathorax, though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments (as in the fly shown, where the metathoracic wings have been reduced to tiny balancing organs called  halteres). <mark>In the  Apocritan Hymenoptera, the first abdominal <u>segment</u>  is fused to the metathorax, where it forms a structure known as the  propodeum.</mark> Accordingly, in these insects, the functional thorax is composed of four segments, and is therefore typically called the  mesosoma to distinguish it from the "thorax" of other insects.Each thoracic segment in insects is further subdivided into various parts, the most significant of which are the <u>dorsal</u>  portion (the  notum), the lateral portion (the  pleuron; one on each side), and the ventral portion (the  sternum). In some insects, each of these parts is composed of one to several independent exoskeletal plates with <u>membrane</u>  between them (called  sclerites), though in many cases the sclerites are fused to various degrees.</td>

      <td><mark>Modernist <u>poetry</u>  is a mode of writing that is characterised by two main features.</mark> The first is technical innovation in the writing through the extensive <u>use</u>  of  free verse. The second is a move away from the  Romantic idea of an unproblematic poetic 'self' directly addressing an equally unproblematic ideal reader or audience.Modernist poetry in English is generally considered to have emerged in the early years of the 20th <u>century</u>  with the appearance of the  Imagist  poets. In common with many other modernists, these poets were writing in reaction to what they saw as the excesses of  Victorian poetry, with its <u>emphasis</u>  on traditional  formalism and overly flowery  poetic diction. In many respects, their criticism of contemporary poetry echoes what  William Wordsworth wrote in the Preface to  Lyrical Ballads to instigate the Romantic movement in British poetry over a <u>century</u>  earlier.In general, the modernists saw themselves as looking back to the best practices of poets in earlier periods and other cultures. Their models included ancient  Greek literature,  Chinese and  Japanese poetry, the  troubadours, Dante and the medieval Italian  philosophical poets (such as  Guido Cavalcanti), and the English  Metaphysical poets.Much of the early <u>poetry</u>  produced by these writers took the form of short, compact  lyrics. However, as modernist <u>poetry</u>  in English developed, longer poems came to the fore. These long poems represent the main <u>contribution</u>  of the modernist movement to the 20th century English poetic canon.</td>

The <u>theory</u>  that hydrocarbons were formed from these remains was first introduced by  Mikhail Lomonosov in 1757. In common dialogue, the <u>term</u>  fossil fuel also includes  hydrocarbon-containing  natural resources that are not derived from animal or plant sources. These are sometimes known instead as mineral fuels. The utilization of fossil fuels has enabled large-scale industrial development and largely supplanted water-driven mills, as well as the combustion of wood or  peat for heat.Fossil fuel is a general term for buried combustible geologic deposits of organic materials, formed from decayed plants and animals that have been converted to crude oil, coal, natural gas, or heavy oils by <u>exposure</u>  to heat and pressure in the earth's crust over hundreds of millions of years. When generating electricity, energy from the  <u>combustion</u>  of fossil fuels is often used to power a  turbine. Older generators often used steam generated by the burning of the fuel to turn the turbine, but in newer power plants the gases produced by burning of the <u>fuel</u>  turn a  gas turbine directly.With global modernization in the 20th and 21st centuries, the thirst for energy from fossil fuels, especially  gasoline derived from oil, is one of the causes of major regional and global conflicts. A global movement toward the generation of  renewable energy is therefore underway to help meet the increased global energy needs.The burning of fossil fuels by humans is the largest source of emissions of carbon dioxide, which is one of the  <u>greenhouse</u>  gases that allows  radiative forcing and contributes to global warming. <mark>A small portion of hydrocarbon-based fuels are biofuels derived from atmospheric carbon dioxide, and thus do not increase the net amount of <u>carbon</u>  dioxide in the atmosphere.</mark></td>

In common with many other modernists, these poets were writing in reaction to what they saw as the excesses of  Victorian poetry, with its <u>emphasis</u>  on traditional  formalism and overly flowery  poetic diction. In many respects, their criticism of contemporary poetry echoes what  William Wordsworth wrote in the Preface to  Lyrical Ballads to instigate the Romantic movement in British poetry over a <u>century</u>  earlier.In general, the modernists saw themselves as looking back to the best practices of poets in earlier periods and other cultures. Their models included ancient  Greek literature,  Chinese and  Japanese poetry, the  troubadours, Dante and the medieval Italian  philosophical poets (such as  Guido Cavalcanti), and the English  Metaphysical poets.Much of the early <u>poetry</u>  produced by these writers took the form of short, compact  lyrics. <mark>However, as modernist <u>poetry</u>  in English developed, longer poems came to the fore.</mark> These long poems represent the main <u>contribution</u>  of the modernist movement to the 20th century English poetic canon.</td>

      <td>The Bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) is a very hairy member of the  pig <u>family</u>  that lives in forest thickets, riverine vegetation and reedbeds close to water in Africa. <mark>They are mainly  nocturnal and are seldom seen during the day.They range in <u>size</u>  from 60 to 85cm (24 – 33 in.)</mark> at the shoulder and 46 to 82kg (101-180 lbs) in weight.The Bushpig resembles the domestic <u>pig</u>  and is identified by the blunt, muscular snout, small eyes, and pointed, tufted ears. Their <u>colour</u>  varies from reddish-brown to dark brown and becomes darker with age. Both sexes have a lighter coloured  <u>mane</u>  which bristles when the animal becomes agitated. The upper parts of the <u>face</u>  and ears are also lighter in colour. Sharp tusks are not very long and are not conspicuous. Unlike the  Warthog, the Bushpig runs with its <u>tail</u>  down. Males are normally larger than females.Bushpigs are quite social animals and are found in sounders of up to 12 members. A typical <u>group</u>  will consist of a dominant male and a dominant female, with other females and juveniles accounting for the rest. Litters of 3-4 young are born in summer after a gestation <u>period</u>  of ± 4 months. Bushpigs can be very aggressive, especially when they have young.They are  Omnivorous and their <u>diet</u>  could include roots, crops,  carrion, as well as newborn lambs. They grunt softly while foraging and make a long, resonant growl as an alarm call.Still distributed over a relatively wide natural range, the <u>bushpig</u>  occurs from Somalia to eastern and southern former Zaire and southwards to Cape Province and Natal in South Africa (Oliver, 1993), having probably been introduced on Madagascar, Comoro and Mayotte Islands (Wilson & Reeder, 1993).The word 'Bushpig' may also be used to describe a very unattractive female, particualy in Australia.

      <td>Saffron ( IPA: [ˈsæf.ɹən] / [ˈsæf.ɹɔn]) is a  spice derived from the flower of the saffron <u>crocus</u>  (Crocus sativus), a species of  crocus in the family  Iridaceae. The <u>flower</u>  has three stigmas, which are the  distal ends of the plant's  carpels. Together with its style, the stalk connecting the stigmas to the rest of the plant, these components are often  dried and used in  cooking as a  <u>seasoning</u>  and  colouring agent. Saffron, which has for decades been the world's most expensive <u>spice</u>  by weight, is native to  Southwest Asia. It was first cultivated in the <u>vicinity</u>  of Greece.Saffron is characterised by a bitter  taste and an  iodoform- or  hay-like fragrance; these are caused by the  chemicals  picrocrocin and  safranal. It also contains a  <u>carotenoid</u>  dye,  crocin, that gives food a rich golden-yellow hue. These traits make <u>saffron</u>  a much-sought ingredient in many foods worldwide. Saffron also has medicinal applications.The word saffron originated from the 12th-century  Old French term safran, which derives from the Latin <u>word</u>  safranum. Safranum is also related to the  Italian zafferano and Spanish azafrán. <mark>Safranum comes from the Arabic <u>word</u>  aṣfar (أَصْفَر), which means " yellow," via the  paronymous zaʻfarān (زَعْفَرَان), the name of the spice in Arabic.</mark></td>

      <td>The concept of <u>entropy</u>  in thermodynamics is central to the  second law of thermodynamics, which deals with physical processes and whether they occur spontaneously. Spontaneous changes occur with an <u>increase</u>  in entropy. In contrast the  first law of thermodynamics deals with the <u>concept</u>  of energy, which is  conserved. We already have five oranges, if Valentine buys three more then we'll have RIDDLE-TOKEN  oranges. Entropy <u>change</u>  has often been defined as a change to a more disordered state at a microscopic level. In recent years, <u>entropy</u>  has been interpreted in terms of the " dispersal" of energy. Entropy is an  extensive  <u>state</u>  function that accounts for the effects of  irreversibility in  thermodynamic systems.Quantitatively, entropy, symbolized by S, is defined by the differential quantity dS = δQ / T, where δQ is the amount of heat absorbed in a  reversible process in which the system goes from one  state to another, and T is the  absolute temperature. Entropy is one of the factors that determines the  free <u>energy</u>  of the system.When a system's energy is defined as the sum of its "useful" energy, (e.g. <mark>that energy which cannot be used for  external work, then entropy may be (most concretely) visualized as the "scrap" or "useless" energy whose energetic prevalence over the total energy of a system is directly proportional to the absolute <u>temperature</u>  of the considered  system, as is the case with the  Gibbs free energy or  Helmholtz free energy relations.In terms of  statistical mechanics, the entropy describes the number of the possible  microscopic configurations of the system.</mark> The statistical <u>definition</u>  of entropy is generally thought to be the more fundamental definition, from which all other important properties of entropy follow. Although the concept of entropy was originally a thermodynamic construct, it has been adapted in other fields of study, including  <u>information</u>  theory,  psychodynamics,  thermoeconomics, and evolution.</td>

She subsequently emerged at the forefront of the  pop music scene in late 1998, thanks to her chart-topping <u>debut</u>  album,  ...Baby One More Time, which was crafted by  producer- songwriter  Max Martin. There are either five or six talks today, so that's at least RIDDLE-TOKEN . Her second album,  Oops!...I Did It Again, which was released the following year, was a similarly huge hit.In the early 2000s, Spears' success as a singer led her way to high-profile <u>advertising</u>  deals, most notably for  Pepsi, as well as forays into other forms of media, including film and  reality television. Along with her highly-publicized relationship with  'N Sync's  Justin Timberlake, her third and fourth albums were released during this <u>era</u>  and included more artistic input from Spears, but yielded lower sales.In 2004, she married dancer and aspiring  rap  artist  Kevin Federline and the following year she gave birth to their son, Sean Preston. Eight weeks after the <u>birth</u>  of her second child, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing  irreconcilable differences. Spears' fifth <u>studio</u>  album is due to be released in early 2007.</td>

      <td>Film is a term that encompasses motion pictures as individual projects, as well as the <u>field</u>  in general. The origin of the name comes from the <u>fact</u>  that  photographic film (also called  filmstock) has historically been the primary  medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. <mark>Many other terms exist for an individual <u>motion</u>  picture, including picture, picture show, photoplay, flick, and most commonly, movie.</mark> Additional terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the cinema, and the movies.Films are produced by  recording actual people and objects with  cameras, or by creating them using <u>animation</u>  techniques and/or  special effects. They comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown rapidly in succession, the <u>illusion</u>  of motion is given to the viewer. Flickering between  frames is not seen due to an effect known as  <u>persistence</u>  of vision — whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion; a psychological <u>effect</u>  identified as  beta movement.Film is considered by many to be an important art form; films entertain, educate, enlighten and inspire audiences. The visual elements of cinema need no translation, giving the motion <u>picture</u>  a universal power of communication. Any <u>film</u>  can become a worldwide attraction, especially with the addition of  dubbing or  subtitles that translate the dialogue.</td>

It does not take into account other potential sources of error such as <u>bias</u>  in the questions, bias due to excluding groups who could not be contacted, people refusing to respond or lying, or miscounts and miscalculations.</td>

The movement employs a <u>program</u>  of non-formal education with emphasis on practical activities in the outdoors, using the so-called  Scout method with programs targeted for various age groups, as proscribed by the founders of Scouting in the early 20th Century. Most countries have Scouting programs for children and young adults from ages 6 to their early 20s.Scouting began in 1907 when Robert Baden-Powell, a  Lieutenant General in the  British Army, held the first Scouting <u>encampment</u>  at  Brownsea Island, England. <mark>He was at that <u>time</u>  a good friend of  William Alexander Smith, founder of the  Boys' Brigade.</mark> The works of  Ernest Thompson Seton and  Daniel Carter Beard were very influential in the early development of Scouting as well as the <u>basis</u>  of the  Traditional Scouting movement that has developed in the last several years. In many countries, Scouting has become a significant part of popular culture.The <u>movement</u>  is not without controversy.

      <td>Sickle-cell disease is a general term for a group of  genetic disorders caused by  sickle <u>hemoglobin</u>  (Hgb S or Hb S). <mark>In many forms of the  disease, the  red blood cells change shape, usually looking much like that of a banana, upon deoxygenation because of polymerization of the abnormal <u>sickle</u>  hemoglobin.</mark> This process damages the red blood <u>cell</u>  membrane, and can cause the cells to become stuck in blood vessels. This deprives the downstream tissues of oxygen and causes  <u>ischemia</u>  and  infarction. The <u>disease</u>  is chronic and lifelong. Individuals are most often well, but their lives are punctuated by periodic painful attacks. In <u>addition</u>  to periodic pain, there may be damage of internal organs, such as stroke. Lifespan is often shortened with sufferers living to an <u>average</u>  of 40 years. Sickle-cell disease occurs more commonly in people (or their descendants) from parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, where <u>malaria</u>  is or was common. Sickle-cell disease can occur in any individual of any <u>colour</u>  or ethnicity, however.</td>

In common dialogue, the <u>term</u>  fossil fuel also includes  hydrocarbon-containing  natural resources that are not derived from animal or plant sources. These are sometimes known instead as mineral fuels. The utilization of fossil fuels has enabled large-scale industrial development and largely supplanted water-driven mills, as well as the combustion of wood or  peat for heat.Fossil fuel is a general term for buried combustible geologic deposits of organic materials, formed from decayed plants and animals that have been converted to crude oil, coal, natural gas, or heavy oils by <u>exposure</u>  to heat and pressure in the earth's crust over hundreds of millions of years. <mark>When generating electricity, energy from the  <u>combustion</u>  of fossil fuels is often used to power a  turbine.</mark> Older generators often used steam generated by the burning of the fuel to turn the turbine, but in newer power plants the gases produced by burning of the <u>fuel</u>  turn a  gas turbine directly.With global modernization in the 20th and 21st centuries, the thirst for energy from fossil fuels, especially  gasoline derived from oil, is one of the causes of major regional and global conflicts. A global movement toward the generation of  renewable energy is therefore underway to help meet the increased global energy needs.The burning of fossil fuels by humans is the largest source of emissions of carbon dioxide, which is one of the  <u>greenhouse</u>  gases that allows  radiative forcing and contributes to global warming.

      <td>Modernist <u>poetry</u>  is a mode of writing that is characterised by two main features. <mark>The first is technical innovation in the writing through the extensive <u>use</u>  of  free verse.</mark> The second is a move away from the  Romantic idea of an unproblematic poetic 'self' directly addressing an equally unproblematic ideal reader or audience.Modernist poetry in English is generally considered to have emerged in the early years of the 20th <u>century</u>  with the appearance of the  Imagist  poets. In common with many other modernists, these poets were writing in reaction to what they saw as the excesses of  Victorian poetry, with its <u>emphasis</u>  on traditional  formalism and overly flowery  poetic diction. In many respects, their criticism of contemporary poetry echoes what  William Wordsworth wrote in the Preface to  Lyrical Ballads to instigate the Romantic movement in British poetry over a <u>century</u>  earlier.In general, the modernists saw themselves as looking back to the best practices of poets in earlier periods and other cultures. Their models included ancient  Greek literature,  Chinese and  Japanese poetry, the  troubadours, Dante and the medieval Italian  philosophical poets (such as  Guido Cavalcanti), and the English  Metaphysical poets.Much of the early <u>poetry</u>  produced by these writers took the form of short, compact  lyrics. However, as modernist <u>poetry</u>  in English developed, longer poems came to the fore. These long poems represent the main <u>contribution</u>  of the modernist movement to the 20th century English poetic canon.</td>

Before the <u>enactment</u>  of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bill of Rights protected individual rights only from invasion by the  federal government. After the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted, the Constitution also protected rights from abridgement by state governments, even including some rights that arguably were not protected from <u>abridgement</u>  by the federal government. In the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment, the states could not, among other things, deprive people of the equal <u>protection</u>  of the laws. What exactly such a requirement means, of course, has been the subject of great debate; and the story of the Equal Protection Clause is the gradual <u>explication</u>  of its meaning.For a long while after the Clause became a part of the Constitution, it was interpreted relatively narrowly. During and after World War II, however, the  United States Supreme Court began to construe the Clause more expansively. During the 1960s, the other two branches of the federal <u>government</u>  — the  executive and the  legislative — joined in, as  Congress and the President passed and enforced legislation intended to ensure  equality in education, employment,  housing,  lodging, and government benefits. While an expansive <u>reading</u>  of the Clause was undercut, to some extent, by Court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, the Equal Protection Clause remains an integral part of  U.S. constitutional law.</td>

In common dialogue, the <u>term</u>  fossil fuel also includes  hydrocarbon-containing  natural resources that are not derived from animal or plant sources.

The utilization of fossil fuels has enabled large-scale industrial development and largely supplanted water-driven mills, as well as the combustion of wood or  peat for heat.Fossil fuel is a general term for buried combustible geologic deposits of organic materials, formed from decayed plants and animals that have been converted to crude oil, coal, natural gas, or heavy oils by <u>exposure</u>  to heat and pressure in the earth's crust over hundreds of millions of years. When generating electricity, energy from the  <u>combustion</u>  of fossil fuels is often used to power a  turbine. Older generators often used steam generated by the burning of the fuel to turn the turbine, but in newer power plants the gases produced by burning of the <u>fuel</u>  turn a  gas turbine directly.With global modernization in the 20th and 21st centuries, the thirst for energy from fossil fuels, especially  gasoline derived from oil, is one of the causes of major regional and global conflicts. A global movement toward the generation of  renewable energy is therefore underway to help meet the increased global energy needs.The burning of fossil fuels by humans is the largest source of emissions of carbon dioxide, which is one of the  <u>greenhouse</u>  gases that allows  radiative forcing and contributes to global warming.

      <td>Phosphorus, ( IPA: /ˈfɒsfərəs/,  Greek: phôs meaning "light", and phoros meaning "bearer"), is the chemical <u>element</u>  in the periodic table that has the symbol P and  atomic number 15. A  multivalent  nonmetal of the  <u>nitrogen</u>  group, phosphorus is commonly found in inorganic phosphate rocks and in all  living cells.Phosphorus exists in several  allotropes, most commonly white, red and black. <mark>White phosphorus (P4) contains only four atoms, resulting in very high  ring <u>strain</u>  and instability.</mark> White phosphorus glows in the dark, is highly  flammable and  pyrophoric (self-igniting) upon <u>contact</u>  with air as well as  toxic. Red <u>phosphorus</u>  has a network form which reduces strain and gives greater stability. Red phosphorus does not catch fire in <u>air</u>  at temperatures below 240°C whereas white phosphorus ignites at about 40°C. Black <u>phosphorus</u>  is  amorphous and is the least reactive allotrope.Red phosphorus is formed by heating white phosphorus to 250°C (482°F) or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight.Due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element in nature. It emits a faint glow upon exposure to <u>oxygen</u>  (hence its Greek derivation and the Latin meaning 'morning star') and is an essential element for living organisms. The most important commercial <u>use</u>  of phosphorus-based chemicals is the production of fertilizers. They are also widely used in  explosives,  nerve agents, <u>friction</u>   matches,  fireworks,  pesticides,  toothpaste, and  detergents.</td>

      <td>Modernist <u>poetry</u>  is a mode of writing that is characterised by two main features. The first is technical innovation in the writing through the extensive <u>use</u>  of  free verse. The second is a move away from the  Romantic idea of an unproblematic poetic 'self' directly addressing an equally unproblematic ideal reader or audience.Modernist poetry in English is generally considered to have emerged in the early years of the 20th <u>century</u>  with the appearance of the  Imagist  poets. In common with many other modernists, these poets were writing in reaction to what they saw as the excesses of  Victorian poetry, with its <u>emphasis</u>  on traditional  formalism and overly flowery  poetic diction. In many respects, their criticism of contemporary poetry echoes what  William Wordsworth wrote in the Preface to  Lyrical Ballads to instigate the Romantic movement in British poetry over a <u>century</u>  earlier.In general, the modernists saw themselves as looking back to the best practices of poets in earlier periods and other cultures. <mark>Their models included ancient  Greek literature,  Chinese and  Japanese poetry, the  troubadours, Dante and the medieval Italian  philosophical poets (such as  Guido Cavalcanti), and the English  Metaphysical poets.Much of the early <u>poetry</u>  produced by these writers took the form of short, compact  lyrics.</mark> However, as modernist <u>poetry</u>  in English developed, longer poems came to the fore.

In contrast the  first law of thermodynamics deals with the <u>concept</u>  of energy, which is  conserved. We already have five oranges, if Valentine buys three more then we'll have RIDDLE-TOKEN  oranges. Entropy <u>change</u>  has often been defined as a change to a more disordered state at a microscopic level. In recent years, <u>entropy</u>  has been interpreted in terms of the " dispersal" of energy. Entropy is an  extensive  <u>state</u>  function that accounts for the effects of  irreversibility in  thermodynamic systems.Quantitatively, entropy, symbolized by S, is defined by the differential quantity dS = δQ / T, where δQ is the amount of heat absorbed in a  reversible process in which the system goes from one  state to another, and T is the  absolute temperature. Entropy is one of the factors that determines the  free <u>energy</u>  of the system.When a system's energy is defined as the sum of its "useful" energy, (e.g. that energy which cannot be used for  external work, then entropy may be (most concretely) visualized as the "scrap" or "useless" energy whose energetic prevalence over the total energy of a system is directly proportional to the absolute <u>temperature</u>  of the considered  system, as is the case with the  Gibbs free energy or  Helmholtz free energy relations.In terms of  statistical mechanics, the entropy describes the number of the possible  microscopic configurations of the system. The statistical <u>definition</u>  of entropy is generally thought to be the more fundamental definition, from which all other important properties of entropy follow. Although the concept of entropy was originally a thermodynamic construct, it has been adapted in other fields of study, including  <u>information</u>  theory,  psychodynamics,  thermoeconomics, and evolution.</td>

The seeds can come from three different plants: black mustard ( B. nigra), brown Indian mustard ( B. juncea), and white or yellow mustard ( B. hirta/Sinapis alba).In the  Indian subcontinent they are often used whole, and are quickly fried in oil until they pop to impart a flavor to the oil.Mustard seeds generally take 3-7 days to germinate if placed under the proper conditions, which include a cold <u>atmosphere</u>  and relativly moist soil. Mustard <u>oil</u>  can be extracted from the seeds. <mark>The seeds, particularly the white ones, can also be <u>ground</u>  into a flour, and mixed to a thick paste with a little water to make the condiment  mustard.</mark> The ground <u>mustard</u>  powder is usually mixed with ordinary flour to reduce the strength of the resulting condiment.Other ingredients can be used to mix mustard, for example, sugar, honey,  vinegar, wine, or milk.When initially mixed the sauce is mild in flavor, but it develops in time. Strong mustard has a very powerful (and painful) effect on the nasal membranes if eaten carelessly.The whole seeds can be soaked in liquid before grinding to create whole grain mustard.It is possible to buy ready prepared  <u>mustard</u>  (condiment) in many places.</td>

      <td>Modernist <u>poetry</u>  is a mode of writing that is characterised by two main features. The first is technical innovation in the writing through the extensive <u>use</u>  of  free verse. The second is a move away from the  Romantic idea of an unproblematic poetic 'self' directly addressing an equally unproblematic ideal reader or audience.Modernist poetry in English is generally considered to have emerged in the early years of the 20th <u>century</u>  with the appearance of the  Imagist  poets. <mark>In common with many other modernists, these poets were writing in reaction to what they saw as the excesses of  Victorian poetry, with its <u>emphasis</u>  on traditional  formalism and overly flowery  poetic diction.</mark> In many respects, their criticism of contemporary poetry echoes what  William Wordsworth wrote in the Preface to  Lyrical Ballads to instigate the Romantic movement in British poetry over a <u>century</u>  earlier.In general, the modernists saw themselves as looking back to the best practices of poets in earlier periods and other cultures. Their models included ancient  Greek literature,  Chinese and  Japanese poetry, the  troubadours, Dante and the medieval Italian  philosophical poets (such as  Guido Cavalcanti), and the English  Metaphysical poets.Much of the early <u>poetry</u>  produced by these writers took the form of short, compact  lyrics.

These long poems represent the main <u>contribution</u>  of the modernist movement to the 20th century English poetic canon.</td>

If the level of confidence is 95%, the "true" percentage for the entire population would be within the margin of error around a poll's reported <u>percentage</u>  95% of the time. Equivalently, the <u>margin</u>  of error is the radius of the 95%  confidence interval.Note that the margin of error only takes into account random  sampling error. It does not take into account other potential sources of error such as <u>bias</u>  in the questions, bias due to excluding groups who could not be contacted, people refusing to respond or lying, or miscounts and miscalculations.</td>

He would then categorize and classify evoked responses into one of six distinct stages. These six stages where broken into three levels: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional.

Georgists hold that this implies a perfectly  inelastic supply curve (i.e., zero elasticity), suggesting that a  land <u>value</u>  tax that recovers the rent of land for public purposes would not affect the  opportunity cost of using land, but would instead only decrease the value of owning it. This view is supported by evidence that although land can come on and off the market, <u>market</u>  inventories of land show if anything an inverse relationship to price (i.e., negative elasticity). And although land (especially in the form of, e.g., mineral deposits) must first be discovered in order to have value or be put to use, it is generally conceded that the fruits of scientific discoveries, whether of natural laws or of mineral deposits, cannot rightly be monopolized for purposes of private economic rent capture.Land, particularly geographic locations and <u>mineral</u>  desposits, has historically been the cause of much conflict and dispute;  land reform programmes, which are designed to redistribute possession and/or use of geographic land, are often the cause of much controversy, and conflicts over the economic rent of mineral deposits have contributed to many civil wars, particularly in Africa.

Entropy is one of the factors that determines the  free <u>energy</u>  of the system.When a system's energy is defined as the sum of its "useful" energy, (e.g. that energy which cannot be used for  external work, then entropy may be (most concretely) visualized as the "scrap" or "useless" energy whose energetic prevalence over the total energy of a system is directly proportional to the absolute <u>temperature</u>  of the considered  system, as is the case with the  Gibbs free energy or  Helmholtz free energy relations.In terms of  statistical mechanics, the entropy describes the number of the possible  microscopic configurations of the system. <mark>The statistical <u>definition</u>  of entropy is generally thought to be the more fundamental definition, from which all other important properties of entropy follow.</mark> Although the concept of entropy was originally a thermodynamic construct, it has been adapted in other fields of study, including  <u>information</u>  theory,  psychodynamics,  thermoeconomics, and evolution.</td>

The faster moving current on the outside <u>bend</u>  has more erosive ability and the meander tends to grow in the direction of the outside bend, forming a river cliff. This can be seen in areas where  willows grow on the banks of rivers; on the <u>inside</u>  of meanders, willows are often far from the bank, whilst on the outside of the bend, the roots of the willows are often exposed and undercut, eventually leading the trees to fall into the river.</td>

      <td>Snake charming is the <u>practice</u>  of apparently  hypnotising a  snake by simply playing an instrument. A typical performance may also include handling the snakes or performing other seemingly dangerous acts, as well as other  <u>street</u>  performance staples, like  juggling and  sleight of hand. The practice is most common in India, though other Asian nations such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malaysia are also home to performers, as are the North African countries of Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.Ancient Egypt was home to one form of snake charming, though the <u>practice</u>  as it exists today likely arose in India. It eventually spread throughout  Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. Despite a sort of golden age in the 20th century, snake charming is today in <u>danger</u>  of dying out. This is due to a variety of factors, chief among them the recent enforcement of a  1972 law in India banning <u>ownership</u>  of  serpents. In retaliation, <u>snake</u>  charmers have organised in recent years, protesting the loss of their only means of livelihood, and the government has made some overtures to them.Many snake charmers live a wandering existence, visiting towns and villages on market days and during  festivals. With a few rare exceptions, however, they typically make every <u>effort</u>  to keep themselves from harm's way. For one, the <u>charmer</u>  typically sits out of biting range, and his animal is sluggish and reluctant to attack anyway. More drastic means of protection include removing the creature's  fangs or  venom glands, or even sewing the snake's <u>mouth</u>  shut. <mark>The most popular species are those native to the snake charmer's <u>home</u>  region, typically various kinds of  cobra, though  vipers and other types are also used.</mark></td>

These trails look like <u>someone</u>  has  doodled in the sand.The adult antlion has two pairs of long, narrow, multi-veined  wings in which the apical veins enclose regular oblong spaces, and a long, slender  abdomen. Although they greatly resemble  dragonflies or  damselflies, they belong to an entirely different  <u>order</u>  of insects. Antlions are easily distinguished from damselflies by their longer, prominent, apically clubbed  antennae and different pattern of <u>wing</u>  venation.

In the face of increasing strain, the <u>system</u>  collapsed in 1971, following the United States' suspension of convertibility from dollars to gold.Until the early 1970s, the Bretton Woods system was effective in controlling conflict and in achieving the common goals of the leading states that had created it, especially the United States.</td>

A  multivalent  nonmetal of the  <u>nitrogen</u>  group, phosphorus is commonly found in inorganic phosphate rocks and in all  living cells.Phosphorus exists in several  allotropes, most commonly white, red and black. White phosphorus (P4) contains only four atoms, resulting in very high  ring <u>strain</u>  and instability. <mark>White phosphorus glows in the dark, is highly  flammable and  pyrophoric (self-igniting) upon <u>contact</u>  with air as well as  toxic.</mark> Red <u>phosphorus</u>  has a network form which reduces strain and gives greater stability. Red phosphorus does not catch fire in <u>air</u>  at temperatures below 240°C whereas white phosphorus ignites at about 40°C. Black <u>phosphorus</u>  is  amorphous and is the least reactive allotrope.Red phosphorus is formed by heating white phosphorus to 250°C (482°F) or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight.Due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element in nature. It emits a faint glow upon exposure to <u>oxygen</u>  (hence its Greek derivation and the Latin meaning 'morning star') and is an essential element for living organisms. The most important commercial <u>use</u>  of phosphorus-based chemicals is the production of fertilizers.

Tropical cyclones are distinguished from other cyclonic windstorms such as  nor'easters,  European windstorms, and  polar lows by the heat mechanism that fuels them, which makes them "warm core" <u>storm</u>  systems.Depending on their location and strength, there are various terms by which tropical cyclones are known, such as hurricane, typhoon, tropical storm, cyclonic storm and tropical depression.Tropical cyclones can produce extremely strong winds, tornadoes, torrential rain, high waves, and  storm surges. They are born and sustained over large bodies of warm <u>water</u>  and lose their strength over land; this explains why coastal regions can receive much damage while inland regions are relatively safe. The heavy rains and <u>storm</u>  surges can produce extensive flooding. Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones also can have beneficial effects by relieving <u>drought</u>  conditions. They carry heat away from the tropics, an important <u>mechanism</u>  of the global  atmospheric circulation that maintains equilibrium in the earth's  troposphere.</td>

      <td>The Battle of Bicocca, sometimes known as the Battle of La Bicocca, was fought on  April 27,  1522, during the Italian War of 1521. A combined French and  Venetian force under  Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec, was decisively defeated by an Imperial, Spanish, and  Papal <u>army</u>  under the overall command of  Prospero Colonna. Lautrec then withdrew from  Lombardy, leaving the  Duchy of Milan in Imperial hands.Having been driven from Milan by an Imperial <u>advance</u>  in late 1521, Lautrec had regrouped, attempting to strike at Colonna's lines of communication. When the  Swiss mercenaries in French service did not receive their pay, however, they demanded an immediate battle, and Lautrec was forced to attack Colonna's fortified position in the park of Bicocca, <u>north</u>  of Milan. The Swiss <u>pikemen</u>  advanced over open fields under heavy artillery fire to assault the Imperial positions, but were halted at a sunken road backed by earthworks. <mark>Having suffered massive casualties from the <u>fire</u>  of Spanish  arquebusiers, the Swiss retreated.</mark> Meanwhile, an attempt by French cavalry to flank Colonna's <u>position</u>  proved equally ineffective. The Swiss, unwilling to fight further, marched off to their  cantons a few days later, and Lautrec retreated into Venetian territory with the remnants of his army.The battle is noted chiefly for marking the end of the Swiss dominance among the <u>infantry</u>  of the  Italian Wars, and of the Swiss method of assaults by massed columns of pikemen without support from other troops. It was simultaneously the first of a <u>series</u>  of engagements which established the decisive role of  firearms on the battlefield.</td>

It was carved by the famed Classical sculptor  Phidias ( 5th <u>century</u>  BC) circa  435 BC in  Olympia, Greece.The seated statue occupied the whole width of the aisle of the temple that was built to house it, and was 40 feet (12 meters) tall.

Zeus was a  chryselephantine sculpture, made of <u>ivory</u>  and accented with gold plating. In the sculpture, he was seated on a magnificent <u>throne</u>  of cedarwood, inlaid with ivory, gold, ebony, and precious stones.

Richelieu soon rose in both the Church and the state, becoming a  <u>cardinal</u>  in 1622, and  King Louis XIII's chief minister in 1624. He remained in <u>office</u>  until his death in 1642; he was succeeded by  Jules Cardinal Mazarin.The Cardinal de Richelieu was often known by the title of the King's "Chief Minister." That number between four and six is RIDDLE-TOKEN . As a result, he is sometimes considered to be the world's first  Prime Minister, in the modern <u>sense</u>  of the term. <mark>He sought to consolidate royal <u>power</u>  and crush domestic factions.</mark> By restraining the <u>power</u>  of the nobility, he transformed France into a strong,  centralized state. His chief  foreign policy objective was to check the <u>power</u>  of the Austro-Spanish  Habsburg dynasty. His tenure was marked by the  Thirty Years' War that engulfed Europe.As an advocate for  Samuel de Champlain and of the <u>retention</u>  of  Québec, he founded the  Compagnie des Cent-Associés and saw the  Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye return Québec to French rule under Champlain, after the settlement had been captured by the  Kirkes in 1629. This in part allowed the colony to eventually develop into the heartland of  Francophone <u>culture</u>  in North America.Richelieu was also famous for his patronage of the arts; most notably, he founded the  Académie française, the  learned society responsible for matters pertaining to the French language. Richelieu is also known by the  <u>sobriquet</u>  l'Éminence rouge ("the Red Eminence"), from the red shade of a cardinal's  vestments and the  style "eminence" as a  cardinal. He is also a leading <u>character</u>  in  The Three Musketeers, by  Alexandre Dumas.</td>

It extends from the  <u>neck</u>  to the  diaphragm, not including the  upper limbs. <mark>The  <u>heart</u>  and the  lungs reside in the  thoracic cavity, as well as many  blood vessels.</mark> The inner organs are protected by the  <u>rib</u>  cage and the sternum.In insects and the extinct  trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions (or  tagmata) of the creature's body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments. It is the <u>area</u>  where the  wings and legs attach in insects, or an area of multiple articulating plates in trilobites. In most insects, the <u>thorax</u>  itself is composed of three segments; the  prothorax, the  mesothorax, and the  metathorax. In extant insects, the <u>prothorax</u>  never has wings, though legs are always present in adults; wings (when present) are restricted to at least the mesothorax, and typically also the metathorax, though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments (as in the fly shown, where the metathoracic wings have been reduced to tiny balancing organs called  halteres). In the  Apocritan Hymenoptera, the first abdominal <u>segment</u>  is fused to the metathorax, where it forms a structure known as the  propodeum. Accordingly, in these insects, the functional thorax is composed of four segments, and is therefore typically called the  mesosoma to distinguish it from the "thorax" of other insects.Each thoracic segment in insects is further subdivided into various parts, the most significant of which are the <u>dorsal</u>  portion (the  notum), the lateral portion (the  pleuron; one on each side), and the ventral portion (the  sternum). In some insects, each of these parts is composed of one to several independent exoskeletal plates with <u>membrane</u>  between them (called  sclerites), though in many cases the sclerites are fused to various degrees.</td>

A <u>stream</u>  or river flowing through a wide valley or flat plain will tend to form a meandering stream course as it alternatively erodes and deposits  sediments along its course.

The faster moving current on the outside <u>bend</u>  has more erosive ability and the meander tends to grow in the direction of the outside bend, forming a river cliff. <mark>This can be seen in areas where  willows grow on the banks of rivers; on the <u>inside</u>  of meanders, willows are often far from the bank, whilst on the outside of the bend, the roots of the willows are often exposed and undercut, eventually leading the trees to fall into the river.</mark></td>

Hasekura returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his <u>embassy</u>  seemingly ending with little results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.</td>

      <td><mark>The Cape Porcupine or South African Porcupine, Hystrix africaeaustralis, is a <u>species</u>  of  Old World porcupine.</mark> Contrary to its name, this <u>porcupine</u>  species inhabits much of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding the southwestern deserts of the continent. This rodent is  nocturnal and inhabits rocky outcrops and hills. They <u>shelter</u>  in caves or dens they dig themselves. Female <u>cape</u>  porcupines are the biggest rodents in southern Africa, weighing more than 30  kilograms (66 pounds) and growing more than two feet long. The cape <u>porcupine</u>  is covered in bristly quills varying in thickness. The longest spines grow as long as the animal's <u>body</u>  and quills only eight inches shorter. On its tail, the spines are hollow to make a rattling <u>sound</u>  to scare away  predators. When attacked, the porcupine freezes.If cornered, it turns vicious and charges to stab its <u>attacker</u>  with its quills. Otherwise, the <u>porcupine</u>  may retreat into its burrow, exposing only its quills and making it hard to dislodge.Unlike most rodents, the cape porcupine is very long-lived. The oldest animals can be 15 to 20 years old. They are also fast to grow. Litters of four are nursed for four months and reach adult <u>size</u>  in only a year. The cape <u>porcupine</u>  eats mostly plant material: fruits, roots, tubers, bulbs, and bark. Special  microorganisms in the animal's <u>gut</u>  break down this tough vegetation. The porcupine has also been reported to gnaw on <u>carrion</u>  and bones. Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Porcupine"</td>

In  classical economics it is considered one of three  factors of production, the other two being  capital and  labor; income derived from <u>ownership</u>  or control of natural resources is often referred to as  rent.Land in the economic sense of the term is not produced by human labor, but only by the forces of nature (or God, in theistic views). <mark>Georgists hold that this implies a perfectly  inelastic supply curve (i.e., zero elasticity), suggesting that a  land <u>value</u>  tax that recovers the rent of land for public purposes would not affect the  opportunity cost of using land, but would instead only decrease the value of owning it.</mark> This view is supported by evidence that although land can come on and off the market, <u>market</u>  inventories of land show if anything an inverse relationship to price (i.e., negative elasticity). And although land (especially in the form of, e.g., mineral deposits) must first be discovered in order to have value or be put to use, it is generally conceded that the fruits of scientific discoveries, whether of natural laws or of mineral deposits, cannot rightly be monopolized for purposes of private economic rent capture.Land, particularly geographic locations and <u>mineral</u>  desposits, has historically been the cause of much conflict and dispute;  land reform programmes, which are designed to redistribute possession and/or use of geographic land, are often the cause of much controversy, and conflicts over the economic rent of mineral deposits have contributed to many civil wars, particularly in Africa.

The antlion  larvae eat ants and other insects, while the adult antlion eats  pollen and  nectar.The <u>antlion</u>  larva is often called a "'doodlebug"'. One theory is that it gets this <u>name</u>  from the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while looking for a good location to build its trap. These trails look like <u>someone</u>  has  doodled in the sand.The adult antlion has two pairs of long, narrow, multi-veined  wings in which the apical veins enclose regular oblong spaces, and a long, slender  abdomen. Although they greatly resemble  dragonflies or  damselflies, they belong to an entirely different  <u>order</u>  of insects. Antlions are easily distinguished from damselflies by their longer, prominent, apically clubbed  antennae and different pattern of <u>wing</u>  venation. <mark>They also are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about in the night, in <u>search</u>  of a mate.</mark> The <u>adult</u>  is rarely seen in the wild because it is typically active only in the evening.</td>

Many of these singles were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and <u>production</u>  team,  Holland-Dozier-Holland. The crossover <u>success</u>  of the Supremes during the mid-1960s paved the way for future black soul and R&B; acts to gain mainstream audiences both in the United States and overseas.Founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1959, The Supremes began as a quartet called The Primettes. Founding members  Florence Ballard,  Mary Wilson,  Diana Ross, and  Betty McGlown, all from the  Brewster-Douglas  public housing project in Detroit, were the sister <u>act</u>  to The Primes (later The Temptations). <mark>In 1960,  Barbara Martin replaced McGlown, and the <u>group</u>  signed with Motown in 1961 as The Supremes.</mark> Martin left at the <u>end</u>  of 1961, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a trio. After they achieved <u>success</u>  in the mid-1960s with Ross as the lead singer, Motown president  Berry Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes in 1967, and replaced Ballard with  Cindy Birdsong. Ross left the group for a successful <u>solo</u>  career in 1970, and was replaced by  Jean Terrell. After 1972, the lineup of the Supremes changed frequently, with  Lynda Laurence,  Scherrie Payne, and  Susaye Greene all becoming members before the group ended its eighteen-year <u>existence</u>  in 1977.

The  <u>heart</u>  and the  lungs reside in the  thoracic cavity, as well as many  blood vessels. <mark>The inner organs are protected by the  <u>rib</u>  cage and the sternum.In insects and the extinct  trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions (or  tagmata) of the creature's body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments.</mark> It is the <u>area</u>  where the  wings and legs attach in insects, or an area of multiple articulating plates in trilobites. In most insects, the <u>thorax</u>  itself is composed of three segments; the  prothorax, the  mesothorax, and the  metathorax. In extant insects, the <u>prothorax</u>  never has wings, though legs are always present in adults; wings (when present) are restricted to at least the mesothorax, and typically also the metathorax, though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments (as in the fly shown, where the metathoracic wings have been reduced to tiny balancing organs called  halteres). In the  Apocritan Hymenoptera, the first abdominal <u>segment</u>  is fused to the metathorax, where it forms a structure known as the  propodeum. Accordingly, in these insects, the functional thorax is composed of four segments, and is therefore typically called the  mesosoma to distinguish it from the "thorax" of other insects.Each thoracic segment in insects is further subdivided into various parts, the most significant of which are the <u>dorsal</u>  portion (the  notum), the lateral portion (the  pleuron; one on each side), and the ventral portion (the  sternum). In some insects, each of these parts is composed of one to several independent exoskeletal plates with <u>membrane</u>  between them (called  sclerites), though in many cases the sclerites are fused to various degrees.</td>

The strip of seashore that is submerged at high <u>tide</u>  and exposed at low tide, the  intertidal zone, is an important ecological product of ocean tides.The changing tide produced at a given location on the Earth is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the effects of the rotation of the Earth and the local  bathymetry (the underwater equivalent to topography or  terrain). Though the  gravitational <u>force</u>  exerted by the Sun on the Earth is almost 200 times stronger than that exerted by the Moon, the tidal force produced by the Moon is about twice as strong as that produced by the Sun. Mary cut the cake in seven pieces such that the seven kids get RIDDLE-TOKEN  piece(s) each. The reason for this is that the tidal force is related not to the <u>strength</u>  of a  gravitational field, but to its  gradient. The field gradient decreases with distance from the source more rapidly than does the <u>field</u>  strength; as the Sun is about 400 times further from the Earth than is the Moon, the gradient of the Sun's field, and thus the tidal force produced by the Sun, is weaker.</td>

      <td>Antlions are a  <u>family</u>  of insects in the order  Neuroptera, classified as Myrmeleontidae, from the  Greek "myrmex", meaning "ant", and "leon", meaning "lion". Strictly speaking the term <u>antlion</u>  applies to the larval form of the members of this family. Antlions are worldwide in distribution, most common in arid and sandy habitats, and can be fairly small to very large (wingspan <u>range</u>  of 2-15 cm). Antlions are  omnivorous. The antlion  larvae eat ants and other insects, while the adult antlion eats  pollen and  nectar.The <u>antlion</u>  larva is often called a "'doodlebug"'. One theory is that it gets this <u>name</u>  from the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while looking for a good location to build its trap. These trails look like <u>someone</u>  has  doodled in the sand.The adult antlion has two pairs of long, narrow, multi-veined  wings in which the apical veins enclose regular oblong spaces, and a long, slender  abdomen. Although they greatly resemble  dragonflies or  damselflies, they belong to an entirely different  <u>order</u>  of insects. Antlions are easily distinguished from damselflies by their longer, prominent, apically clubbed  antennae and different pattern of <u>wing</u>  venation. They also are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about in the night, in <u>search</u>  of a mate. <mark>The <u>adult</u>  is rarely seen in the wild because it is typically active only in the evening.</mark></td>

Before election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the  Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs,  papal <u>nuncio</u>  and  cardinal secretary of state, in which roles he worked to conclude treaties with European nations, most notably the  Reichskonkordat with Germany. After World War II, he was a vocal supporter of lenient policies toward vanquished nations, including  <u>amnesty</u>  for  war criminals. He also was a staunch <u>opponent</u>  of communism.Pius is one of few popes in recent history to exercise his  papal infallibility by issuing an  apostolic constitution,  Munificentissimus Deus, which defined  ex cathedra the  dogma of the  Assumption of Mary. He also promulgated  forty-six  encyclicals, including  Humani Generis, which is still relevant to the Church's <u>position</u>  on evolution. He also decisively eliminated the Italian <u>majority</u>  in the  College of Cardinals with the  Grand Consistory in  1946. Most  sedevacantists regard Pope Pius XII as the last true Pope to occupy the  Holy See. His  canonization process progressed to the  Venerable <u>stage</u>  on  September 2,  2000 under Pope John Paul II.</td>

In  classical economics it is considered one of three  factors of production, the other two being  capital and  labor; income derived from <u>ownership</u>  or control of natural resources is often referred to as  rent.Land in the economic sense of the term is not produced by human labor, but only by the forces of nature (or God, in theistic views). Georgists hold that this implies a perfectly  inelastic supply curve (i.e., zero elasticity), suggesting that a  land <u>value</u>  tax that recovers the rent of land for public purposes would not affect the  opportunity cost of using land, but would instead only decrease the value of owning it. This view is supported by evidence that although land can come on and off the market, <u>market</u>  inventories of land show if anything an inverse relationship to price (i.e., negative elasticity). <mark>And although land (especially in the form of, e.g., mineral deposits) must first be discovered in order to have value or be put to use, it is generally conceded that the fruits of scientific discoveries, whether of natural laws or of mineral deposits, cannot rightly be monopolized for purposes of private economic rent capture.Land, particularly geographic locations and <u>mineral</u>  desposits, has historically been the cause of much conflict and dispute;  land reform programmes, which are designed to redistribute possession and/or use of geographic land, are often the cause of much controversy, and conflicts over the economic rent of mineral deposits have contributed to many civil wars, particularly in Africa.</mark> Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_%28economics%29"</td>

She is best known for her  studio albums,  <u>music</u>  videos, and songs such as " ...Baby One More Time", " Oops!...I Did It Again" and " Toxic".Spears has sold over seventy-six million records worldwide according to  TIME magazine. Having sold over 31 million albums in the U.S., Spears ranks as the eighth best-selling female artist in American music history.Spears first came to fame as a <u>member</u>  of the  Mickey Mouse Club in the early 1990s, after which she took a five-year break from entertainment. She subsequently emerged at the forefront of the  pop music scene in late 1998, thanks to her chart-topping <u>debut</u>  album,  ...Baby One More Time, which was crafted by  producer- songwriter  Max Martin. There are either five or six talks today, so that's at least RIDDLE-TOKEN . Her second album,  Oops!...I Did It Again, which was released the following year, was a similarly huge hit.In the early 2000s, Spears' success as a singer led her way to high-profile <u>advertising</u>  deals, most notably for  Pepsi, as well as forays into other forms of media, including film and  reality television. Along with her highly-publicized relationship with  'N Sync's  Justin Timberlake, her third and fourth albums were released during this <u>era</u>  and included more artistic input from Spears, but yielded lower sales.In 2004, she married dancer and aspiring  rap  artist  Kevin Federline and the following year she gave birth to their son, Sean Preston.

      <td>Antlions are a  <u>family</u>  of insects in the order  Neuroptera, classified as Myrmeleontidae, from the  Greek "myrmex", meaning "ant", and "leon", meaning "lion". Strictly speaking the term <u>antlion</u>  applies to the larval form of the members of this family. Antlions are worldwide in distribution, most common in arid and sandy habitats, and can be fairly small to very large (wingspan <u>range</u>  of 2-15 cm). Antlions are  omnivorous. The antlion  larvae eat ants and other insects, while the adult antlion eats  pollen and  nectar.The <u>antlion</u>  larva is often called a "'doodlebug"'. One theory is that it gets this <u>name</u>  from the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while looking for a good location to build its trap. These trails look like <u>someone</u>  has  doodled in the sand.The adult antlion has two pairs of long, narrow, multi-veined  wings in which the apical veins enclose regular oblong spaces, and a long, slender  abdomen. Although they greatly resemble  dragonflies or  damselflies, they belong to an entirely different  <u>order</u>  of insects. <mark>Antlions are easily distinguished from damselflies by their longer, prominent, apically clubbed  antennae and different pattern of <u>wing</u>  venation.</mark> They also are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about in the night, in <u>search</u>  of a mate. The <u>adult</u>  is rarely seen in the wild because it is typically active only in the evening.</td>

These traits make <u>saffron</u>  a much-sought ingredient in many foods worldwide. Saffron also has medicinal applications.The word saffron originated from the 12th-century  Old French term safran, which derives from the Latin <u>word</u>  safranum. Safranum is also related to the  Italian zafferano and Spanish azafrán. Safranum comes from the Arabic <u>word</u>  aṣfar (أَصْفَر), which means " yellow," via the  paronymous zaʻfarān (زَعْفَرَان), the name of the spice in Arabic.</td>

Nature is also generally distinguished from the  supernatural. It ranges in scale from the  subatomic to the galactic.The word "nature" derives from the Latin word natura, or "the <u>course</u>  of things, natural character." Natura was a Latin translation of the Greek word  physis (φύσις), which originally related to the innate way in which plants and animals grow of their own accord, and to the Greek <u>word</u>  for plants generally. The <u>concept</u>  of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is a more recent development that gained increasingly wide use with the advent of modern  scientific method in the last several centuries.Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" may refer to the general realm of various types of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects – the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth, and the matter and energy of which all these things are composed. It is often taken to mean the " natural environment" or  <u>wilderness</u>  – wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found <u>today</u>  implies a distinction between the natural and the  artificial, with the latter being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human or human-like  consciousness or mind.</td>

The eruption may have started a few days earlier and lasted until  5 June  1967, when the island reached its maximum <u>size</u>  of  2.7  km². <mark>Since then, wind and wave erosion has seen the island steadily diminish in size:  as of 2005 it is only 1.4 km² in size.The new island was named after the fire giant  Surtur from Norse mythology, and was intensively studied by  volcanologists during its creation and, since the <u>end</u>  of the eruption, has been of great interest to botanists and biologists as life has gradually colonised the originally barren island.</mark> The undersea vents that produced Surtsey are part of the  Vestmannaeyjar (Westmann Isles) submarine volcanic system, part of the <u>fissure</u>  of the sea floor called the  Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Vestmannaeyjar also produced the famous <u>eruption</u>  of Eldfell on the island of  Heimaey in 1973.

"Despite his successes in television, Aubrey's abrasive personality and oversized ego — "Picture  Machiavelli and  Karl Rove at a  University of Colorado <u>football</u>  recruiting party" wrote Variety in 2004 — led to his firing from CBS amid charges of improprieties.

Antlions are worldwide in distribution, most common in arid and sandy habitats, and can be fairly small to very large (wingspan <u>range</u>  of 2-15 cm). Antlions are  omnivorous. The antlion  larvae eat ants and other insects, while the adult antlion eats  pollen and  nectar.The <u>antlion</u>  larva is often called a "'doodlebug"'. One theory is that it gets this <u>name</u>  from the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while looking for a good location to build its trap. These trails look like <u>someone</u>  has  doodled in the sand.The adult antlion has two pairs of long, narrow, multi-veined  wings in which the apical veins enclose regular oblong spaces, and a long, slender  abdomen. Although they greatly resemble  dragonflies or  damselflies, they belong to an entirely different  <u>order</u>  of insects. Antlions are easily distinguished from damselflies by their longer, prominent, apically clubbed  antennae and different pattern of <u>wing</u>  venation. They also are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about in the night, in <u>search</u>  of a mate. The <u>adult</u>  is rarely seen in the wild because it is typically active only in the evening.</td>

Compare  vessel.During the  age of sail, <u>ship</u>  signified a  ship-rigged vessel, that is, one with three or more masts, usually three, all  square-rigged. Such a vessel would normally have one fore and aft <u>sail</u>  on her aftermost mast which was usually the mizzen.

The same economic pressures which increased sizes to the point of carrying four or five masts, also introduced the <u>fore</u>  and aft rig to larger vessels, so few ship-rigged vessels were built with more than three masts. The five-masted  Preussen was the outstanding example, but the big  German ships and  barques were built partly for  <u>prestige</u>  reasons.

      <td>A meander is a bend in a river, also known as an <u>oxbow</u>  loop. A <u>stream</u>  or river flowing through a wide valley or flat plain will tend to form a meandering stream course as it alternatively erodes and deposits  sediments along its course. <mark>The <u>result</u>  is a snaking pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its  floodplain.</mark> When a meander gets cut off from the main <u>stream</u>  body, an oxbow lake is formed.A meander is formed because the river flows faster on the outside edge of any small curve and slower along the inside edge. Deposition of  <u>sediment</u>  occurs on the inner edge because the river, moving slowly, cannot carry its sediment load, creating a slip-off slope. The faster moving current on the outside <u>bend</u>  has more erosive ability and the meander tends to grow in the direction of the outside bend, forming a river cliff. This can be seen in areas where  willows grow on the banks of rivers; on the <u>inside</u>  of meanders, willows are often far from the bank, whilst on the outside of the bend, the roots of the willows are often exposed and undercut, eventually leading the trees to fall into the river.</td>

A  multivalent  nonmetal of the  <u>nitrogen</u>  group, phosphorus is commonly found in inorganic phosphate rocks and in all  living cells.Phosphorus exists in several  allotropes, most commonly white, red and black. White phosphorus (P4) contains only four atoms, resulting in very high  ring <u>strain</u>  and instability.

Red phosphorus does not catch fire in <u>air</u>  at temperatures below 240°C whereas white phosphorus ignites at about 40°C. Black <u>phosphorus</u>  is  amorphous and is the least reactive allotrope.Red phosphorus is formed by heating white phosphorus to 250°C (482°F) or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight.Due to its high reactivity, phosphorus is never found as a free element in nature.

Nature is also generally distinguished from the  supernatural. It ranges in scale from the  subatomic to the galactic.The word "nature" derives from the Latin word natura, or "the <u>course</u>  of things, natural character." Natura was a Latin translation of the Greek word  physis (φύσις), which originally related to the innate way in which plants and animals grow of their own accord, and to the Greek <u>word</u>  for plants generally. The <u>concept</u>  of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is a more recent development that gained increasingly wide use with the advent of modern  scientific method in the last several centuries.Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" may refer to the general realm of various types of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects – the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth, and the matter and energy of which all these things are composed. It is often taken to mean the " natural environment" or  <u>wilderness</u>  – wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. <mark>This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found <u>today</u>  implies a distinction between the natural and the  artificial, with the latter being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human or human-like  consciousness or mind.</mark></td>

Entropy <u>change</u>  has often been defined as a change to a more disordered state at a microscopic level. In recent years, <u>entropy</u>  has been interpreted in terms of the " dispersal" of energy. Entropy is an  extensive  <u>state</u>  function that accounts for the effects of  irreversibility in  thermodynamic systems.Quantitatively, entropy, symbolized by S, is defined by the differential quantity dS = δQ / T, where δQ is the amount of heat absorbed in a  reversible process in which the system goes from one  state to another, and T is the  absolute temperature. Entropy is one of the factors that determines the  free <u>energy</u>  of the system.When a system's energy is defined as the sum of its "useful" energy, (e.g. that energy which cannot be used for  external work, then entropy may be (most concretely) visualized as the "scrap" or "useless" energy whose energetic prevalence over the total energy of a system is directly proportional to the absolute <u>temperature</u>  of the considered  system, as is the case with the  Gibbs free energy or  Helmholtz free energy relations.In terms of  statistical mechanics, the entropy describes the number of the possible  microscopic configurations of the system. The statistical <u>definition</u>  of entropy is generally thought to be the more fundamental definition, from which all other important properties of entropy follow. Although the concept of entropy was originally a thermodynamic construct, it has been adapted in other fields of study, including  <u>information</u>  theory,  psychodynamics,  thermoeconomics, and evolution.</td>

During and after World War II, however, the  United States Supreme Court began to construe the Clause more expansively. During the 1960s, the other two branches of the federal <u>government</u>  — the  executive and the  legislative — joined in, as  Congress and the President passed and enforced legislation intended to ensure  equality in education, employment,  housing,  lodging, and government benefits. While an expansive <u>reading</u>  of the Clause was undercut, to some extent, by Court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, the Equal Protection Clause remains an integral part of  U.S. constitutional law.</td>

The tapes with the year in the title usually were released before Christmas or early the following year, and were very big sellers.With the advent of affordable, consumer-level  digital audio, creating and distributing mixes in the form of a compact disc or  MP3  playlist has become the contemporary method of choice, but the term mixtape is still commonly used, and will be used throughout this <u>article</u>  to refer to mixes in different media (CD,  MP3,  MiniDisc,  audio cassette  8 track, etc. ).A mixtape, which usually reflects the musical tastes of its compiler, can range from a casually selected list of favorite songs, to a  conceptual mix of songs linked by a  theme or mood, to a highly personal <u>statement</u>  tailored to the tape's intended recipient.

It extends from the  <u>neck</u>  to the  diaphragm, not including the  upper limbs. The  <u>heart</u>  and the  lungs reside in the  thoracic cavity, as well as many  blood vessels. The inner organs are protected by the  <u>rib</u>  cage and the sternum.In insects and the extinct  trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions (or  tagmata) of the creature's body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments. It is the <u>area</u>  where the  wings and legs attach in insects, or an area of multiple articulating plates in trilobites. <mark>In most insects, the <u>thorax</u>  itself is composed of three segments; the  prothorax, the  mesothorax, and the  metathorax.</mark> In extant insects, the <u>prothorax</u>  never has wings, though legs are always present in adults; wings (when present) are restricted to at least the mesothorax, and typically also the metathorax, though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments (as in the fly shown, where the metathoracic wings have been reduced to tiny balancing organs called  halteres). In the  Apocritan Hymenoptera, the first abdominal <u>segment</u>  is fused to the metathorax, where it forms a structure known as the  propodeum. Accordingly, in these insects, the functional thorax is composed of four segments, and is therefore typically called the  mesosoma to distinguish it from the "thorax" of other insects.Each thoracic segment in insects is further subdivided into various parts, the most significant of which are the <u>dorsal</u>  portion (the  notum), the lateral portion (the  pleuron; one on each side), and the ventral portion (the  sternum). In some insects, each of these parts is composed of one to several independent exoskeletal plates with <u>membrane</u>  between them (called  sclerites), though in many cases the sclerites are fused to various degrees.</td>

"It seems that if Zeus were to stand up," the <u>geographer</u>   Strabo noted early in the 1st century BC, "he would unroof the temple." <mark>Zeus was a  chryselephantine sculpture, made of <u>ivory</u>  and accented with gold plating.</mark> In the sculpture, he was seated on a magnificent <u>throne</u>  of cedarwood, inlaid with ivory, gold, ebony, and precious stones.

According to  Lucian of Samosata in the later second century, "they have laid hands on your person at Olympia, my lord High-Thunderer, and you had not the energy to wake the dogs or call in the neighbours; surely they might have come to the <u>rescue</u>  and caught the fellows before they had finished packing up the swag. "Perhaps the greatest  discovery in terms of finding out about this wonder came in  1958 with the excavation of the <u>workshop</u>  used to create the statue.

If there are five kiwi(s) and you take away three, then there remains only RIDDLE-TOKEN . Through their track selection and mixing techniques, Sasha and Digweed were instrumental in the evolution of  progressive <u>trance</u>  and  house.Sasha has produced multiple UK-charting singles and has  remixed tracks for such artists as  Madonna and  The Chemical Brothers. His <u>remixing</u>  earned him a  Grammy nomination for his 2004 remix of  Felix Da Housecat's "Watching Cars Go By". Sasha's remixing and production often combine electronic genres, making it difficult for critics to pinpoint a single variety of <u>music</u>  as Sasha's. This was most prevalent on his <u>debut</u>  artist album  Airdrawndagger, which surprised many critics with its unusual cross-genre style.Sasha worked with younger DJs and producers such as  Brian Transeau and  James Zabiela, greatly affecting their musical styles and techniques. Through his <u>use</u>  of  Ableton Live, Sasha helped popularise modern technological innovations among DJs who formerly relied on  records and  turntables. Despite the changing trends in electronic dance music, Sasha continues to attract crowds at <u>dance</u>  clubs. As of late 2006, Sasha is on an intercontinental <u>tour</u>  and gathering material for future mix albums.</td>

At the <u>turn</u>  of the 20th century, books by authors such as  W.E.B. DuBois and  Booker T. Washington debated whether to confront or appease racist attitudes in the United States. There are either five or eight talks today, so that's at least RIDDLE-TOKEN . <mark>During the  American Civil Rights movement, authors like  Richard Wright and  Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about issues of  racial <u>segregation</u>  and  black nationalism.</mark> Today, African American <u>literature</u>  has become accepted as an integral part of  American literature, with books such as  Roots: The Saga of an American Family by  Alex Haley,  The Colour Purple by  Alice Walker, and  Beloved by Toni Morrison achieving both best-selling and award-winning status.</td>

The <u>result</u>  is a snaking pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its  floodplain.

The faster moving current on the outside <u>bend</u>  has more erosive ability and the meander tends to grow in the direction of the outside bend, forming a river cliff. This can be seen in areas where  willows grow on the banks of rivers; on the <u>inside</u>  of meanders, willows are often far from the bank, whilst on the outside of the bend, the roots of the willows are often exposed and undercut, eventually leading the trees to fall into the river.</td>

The chemical properties of this silvery grey,  radioactive, crystalline  <u>transition</u>  metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.

Mendeleev noted a <u>gap</u>  in his periodic table and called the element ekamanganese. In 1937 its isotope 97Tc became the first <u>element</u>  to be artificially produced, hence its name (from the  Greek τεχνητος, meaning "artificial"). <mark>Most technetium produced on Earth is a by-product of <u>fission</u>  of  uranium-235 in  nuclear reactors and is extracted from  nuclear fuel rods.</mark> No isotope of technetium has a  half-life longer than 4.2 million years (98Tc), so its <u>detection</u>  in red giants in 1952 helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements. On earth, technetium occurs naturally only in uranium ores as a <u>product</u>  of  spontaneous fission; the quantities are minute but have been measured.</td>

It was a  bipedal carnivore with a long, stiffened <u>tail</u>  and had an enlarged, sickle-shaped  claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to kill its  prey. Velociraptor can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low  skull, with an upturned snout.Due in large <u>part</u>  to its prominent role in  Michael Crichton's novel  Jurassic Park and the subsequent  motion picture series, Velociraptor (commonly shortened to 'raptor') is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public. It is also well-known to paleontologists, with over a <u>dozen</u>  recovered fossil skeletons — the most of any dromaeosaurid. One particularly famous <u>specimen</u>  shows a Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops.</td>

      <td>A <u>cloud</u>  is a visible mass of condensed  droplets or frozen crystals suspended in the  atmosphere above the surface of the Earth or another  planetary body. The branch of meteorology in which clouds are studied is  nephology.On Earth, the condensing substance is water vapor, which forms small droplets of water or <u>ice</u>  crystals, typically 0.01 mm in diameter. When surrounded with billions of other droplets or crystals, they are visible as clouds. Dense deep clouds exhibit a high <u>reflectance</u>  (70% to 95%) throughout the  visible range of wavelengths: they thus appear  white, at least from the top. Cloud droplets tend to  scatter light very efficiently, so that the intensity of the solar radiation decreases with <u>depth</u>  into the cloud, hence the  grey or even sometimes dark appearance of the clouds at their  base. Thin clouds may appear to have acquired the colour of their environment or background, and clouds illuminated by non-white light, such as during  <u>sunrise</u>  or  sunset, may be colored accordingly. <mark>In the near-infrared range, however, clouds would appear very dark because the <u>water</u>  that constitutes the cloud droplets strongly absorbs solar radiation at these wavelengths.</mark></td>

Males are normally larger than females.Bushpigs are quite social animals and are found in sounders of up to 12 members. A typical <u>group</u>  will consist of a dominant male and a dominant female, with other females and juveniles accounting for the rest.

Its naturalistic future setting, modeled after traditional  Western movie motifs, presents an atypical <u>science</u>  fiction backdrop for the narrative. It was conceived by <u>writer</u>  and director  Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and  Angel, under his production tag,  Mutant Enemy. Whedon served as  executive producer, along with  Tim Minear.Firefly was originally broadcast on the  FOX <u>network</u>  but was cancelled after only eleven of the fourteen produced episodes were aired. Despite the series' relatively short <u>life</u>  span, it won an  Emmy in  2003 for "Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series", received strong sales when it was released onto DVD, and had impressive fan support campaigns. This led Whedon and  Universal Pictures to produce a film based on the series, titled Serenity after the fictional  <u>spaceship</u>  featured in the show.The series is set in  2517 AD and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of  Serenity, a Firefly-class spaceship. The  <u>ensemble</u>  cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity. <mark>The <u>show</u>  explores the vicissitudes of people who fought on the losing side of a  civil war, as well as the  pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system.</mark> In addition, it is a future where the only two surviving superpowers are the United States and China, which formed the central federal <u>government</u>  called the  Alliance. According to Whedon, <u>nothing</u>  has changed in the future: there are more people with more advanced technology, but they still have the same problems politically, morally and ethically.</td>

Their models included ancient  Greek literature,  Chinese and  Japanese poetry, the  troubadours, Dante and the medieval Italian  philosophical poets (such as  Guido Cavalcanti), and the English  Metaphysical poets.Much of the early <u>poetry</u>  produced by these writers took the form of short, compact  lyrics.

The pea <u>plant</u>  is an  annual plant, with a  lifecycle of a year. The average <u>pea</u>  weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 grams .Peas are a cool-season vegetable crop. The seeds may be planted as soon as the <u>soil</u>  temperature reaches 10 °C, with the plants growing best at temperatures of 13 °C to 18 °C. They do not thrive in the <u>summer</u>  heat of warmer temperate and lowland tropical climates, but do grow well in cooler high altitude tropical areas. Many cultivars reach <u>maturity</u>  about 60 days after planting. The vining cultivars grow thin  tendrils from leaves that <u>coil</u>  around any available support, and can climb to be 1-2 m high. <mark>A traditional approach to supporting climbing peas is to thrust branches pruned from trees or other <u>woody</u>  plants upright into the soil, providing a lattice for the peas to climb.</mark> Branches used in this fashion are called <u>pea</u>  brush. In dense plantings, peas give each other some <u>measure</u>  of mutual support.</td>

It eventually spread throughout  Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. Despite a sort of golden age in the 20th century, snake charming is today in <u>danger</u>  of dying out. This is due to a variety of factors, chief among them the recent enforcement of a  1972 law in India banning <u>ownership</u>  of  serpents. In retaliation, <u>snake</u>  charmers have organised in recent years, protesting the loss of their only means of livelihood, and the government has made some overtures to them.Many snake charmers live a wandering existence, visiting towns and villages on market days and during  festivals. With a few rare exceptions, however, they typically make every <u>effort</u>  to keep themselves from harm's way. For one, the <u>charmer</u>  typically sits out of biting range, and his animal is sluggish and reluctant to attack anyway. More drastic means of protection include removing the creature's  fangs or  venom glands, or even sewing the snake's <u>mouth</u>  shut. The most popular species are those native to the snake charmer's <u>home</u>  region, typically various kinds of  cobra, though  vipers and other types are also used.</td>

It was introduced to Europe by the  Jesuit  Matteo Ricci, who was the first to  Latinise the <u>name</u>  as "Confucius".His teachings are known primarily through the  Analects of Confucius, a collection of "brief aphoristic fragments", which was compiled many years after his death. Modern historians do not believe that any specific documents can be said to have been written by Confucius, but for nearly 2,000 years he was thought to be the <u>editor</u>  or author of all the  Five Classics such as the  Classic of Rites, and the  Spring and Autumn Annals.</td>

      <td>Kohlberg's stages of moral development are planes of moral adequacy conceived by  Lawrence Kohlberg to explain the <u>development</u>  of  moral reasoning. Created while studying <u>psychology</u>  at the University of Chicago, the theory was inspired by the work of  Jean Piaget and a fascination with children's reactions to  moral dilemmas. He wrote his doctoral dissertation at the university in 1958, outlining what are now known as his stages of moral development.This  theory holds that moral reasoning, which is the <u>basis</u>  for  ethical behaviour, has six identifiable  developmental stages. He followed the development of moral <u>judgment</u>  beyond the ages originally studied by Piaget, who claimed that logic and morality develop through  constructive stages. Kohlberg expanded considerably on this groundwork, determining that the process of moral development was principally concerned with <u>justice</u>  and that its development continued throughout the  lifespan, even spawning dialogue of philosophical implications of his research.Kohlberg used stories about moral dilemmas in his studies, and was interested in how people would justify their actions if they were put in a similar moral crux. He would then categorize and classify evoked responses into one of six distinct stages. These six stages where broken into three levels: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. <mark>His theory is based on constructive developmental stages; each stage and <u>level</u>  is more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than the last.</mark></td>

      <td>The Equal Protection Clause, part of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, provides that "no state shall… deny to any person within its  <u>jurisdiction</u>  the equal protection of the laws." The Equal Protection Clause can be seen as an attempt to secure the promise of the United States' professed commitment to the proposition that " all men are created equal" by empowering the judicary to enforce that principle against the states.More concretely, the Equal Protection Clause, along with the <u>rest</u>  of the Fourteenth Amendment, marked a great shift in American constitutionalism. Before the <u>enactment</u>  of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bill of Rights protected individual rights only from invasion by the  federal government. After the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted, the Constitution also protected rights from abridgement by state governments, even including some rights that arguably were not protected from <u>abridgement</u>  by the federal government. In the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment, the states could not, among other things, deprive people of the equal <u>protection</u>  of the laws. What exactly such a requirement means, of course, has been the subject of great debate; and the story of the Equal Protection Clause is the gradual <u>explication</u>  of its meaning.For a long while after the Clause became a part of the Constitution, it was interpreted relatively narrowly. During and after World War II, however, the  United States Supreme Court began to construe the Clause more expansively. During the 1960s, the other two branches of the federal <u>government</u>  — the  executive and the  legislative — joined in, as  Congress and the President passed and enforced legislation intended to ensure  equality in education, employment,  housing,  lodging, and government benefits. <mark>While an expansive <u>reading</u>  of the Clause was undercut, to some extent, by Court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, the Equal Protection Clause remains an integral part of  U.S. constitutional law.</mark></td>

Accordingly, in these insects, the functional thorax is composed of four segments, and is therefore typically called the  mesosoma to distinguish it from the "thorax" of other insects.Each thoracic segment in insects is further subdivided into various parts, the most significant of which are the <u>dorsal</u>  portion (the  notum), the lateral portion (the  pleuron; one on each side), and the ventral portion (the  sternum). In some insects, each of these parts is composed of one to several independent exoskeletal plates with <u>membrane</u>  between them (called  sclerites), though in many cases the sclerites are fused to various degrees.</td>

      <td>The Equal Protection Clause, part of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, provides that "no state shall… deny to any person within its  <u>jurisdiction</u>  the equal protection of the laws."

      <td>Firefly is an American  science fiction  <u>cult</u>   television series that premiered in the United States and Canada on  September 20,  2002. Its naturalistic future setting, modeled after traditional  Western movie motifs, presents an atypical <u>science</u>  fiction backdrop for the narrative. It was conceived by <u>writer</u>  and director  Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and  Angel, under his production tag,  Mutant Enemy. Whedon served as  executive producer, along with  Tim Minear.Firefly was originally broadcast on the  FOX <u>network</u>  but was cancelled after only eleven of the fourteen produced episodes were aired. Despite the series' relatively short <u>life</u>  span, it won an  Emmy in  2003 for "Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series", received strong sales when it was released onto DVD, and had impressive fan support campaigns. <mark>This led Whedon and  Universal Pictures to produce a film based on the series, titled Serenity after the fictional  <u>spaceship</u>  featured in the show.The series is set in  2517 AD and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of  Serenity, a Firefly-class spaceship.</mark> The  <u>ensemble</u>  cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity. The <u>show</u>  explores the vicissitudes of people who fought on the losing side of a  civil war, as well as the  pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system. In addition, it is a future where the only two surviving superpowers are the United States and China, which formed the central federal <u>government</u>  called the  Alliance. According to Whedon, <u>nothing</u>  has changed in the future: there are more people with more advanced technology, but they still have the same problems politically, morally and ethically.</td>

Natural, raw <u>honey</u>  varies from 14% to 18% moisture content. Arnold cut the cake in eight pieces such that the two kids get RIDDLE-TOKEN  piece(s) each.

Because bees carry an  electrostatic charge, and can attract other particles, the same techniques of melissopalynology can be used in area environmental studies of  radioactive particles,  dust, or particulate pollution.A main effect of bees collecting nectar to make honey is  pollination, which is crucial for  <u>flowering</u>  plants.</td>

Interestingly, this seems to have caused no  inbreeding problems, leading to <u>speculation</u>  that the species has passed through several such population reductions in its evolutionary past and thus losing any  alleles that could cause deleterious inbreeding effects. It was generally assumed that the  minimum viable <u>population</u>  protecting from  inbreeding depression was around 50 individuals, but this is now known to be an inexact average, with the actual numbers being below 10 in rapidly-reproducing small-island species such as the Black Robin, to several hundred in long-lived continental species with a wide distribution (such as elephants or tigers).The species is still  endangered, but now numbers around 250 individuals in a single population on tiny  Little Mangere Island. Ongoing restoration of habitat and eradication of introduced predators is being undertaken so that the population of this and other endangered Chatham  endemics can be spread to several populations, decreasing the risk of <u>extinction</u>  by natural disasters or similar  stochastic events.The binomial commemorates the New Zealand botanist  Henry H.

Both sexes have a lighter coloured  <u>mane</u>  which bristles when the animal becomes agitated. The upper parts of the <u>face</u>  and ears are also lighter in colour. Sharp tusks are not very long and are not conspicuous. Unlike the  Warthog, the Bushpig runs with its <u>tail</u>  down. Males are normally larger than females.Bushpigs are quite social animals and are found in sounders of up to 12 members. A typical <u>group</u>  will consist of a dominant male and a dominant female, with other females and juveniles accounting for the rest. Litters of 3-4 young are born in summer after a gestation <u>period</u>  of ± 4 months. Bushpigs can be very aggressive, especially when they have young.They are  Omnivorous and their <u>diet</u>  could include roots, crops,  carrion, as well as newborn lambs. They grunt softly while foraging and make a long, resonant growl as an alarm call.Still distributed over a relatively wide natural range, the <u>bushpig</u>  occurs from Somalia to eastern and southern former Zaire and southwards to Cape Province and Natal in South Africa (Oliver, 1993), having probably been introduced on Madagascar, Comoro and Mayotte Islands (Wilson & Reeder, 1993).The word 'Bushpig' may also be used to describe a very unattractive female, particualy in Australia.

He is known most notably as <u>author</u>  of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. Hitchhiker's began on radio, and developed into a  "trilogy" of five books (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a  television series, a towel, a comic book series, a  computer <u>game</u>  and a  feature film that was completed after Adams's death. He was known to some fans as Bop Ad (after his illegible signature), or by his initials " DNA".In <u>addition</u>  to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series Doctor Who, and served the series as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the  Dirk Gently novels, and co-author credits on two  Liff books and  Last Chance to See, itself based on a <u>radio</u>  series. Adams also originated the <u>idea</u>  for the computer game  Starship Titanic, which was realized by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by  Terry Jones. A posthumous collection of essays and other material, including an incomplete novel, was published as  The Salmon of Doubt in 2002.His fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist, a self-described "radical  atheist" and a <u>lover</u>  of fast cars, cameras, the Macintosh computer, and other "techno gizmos." <mark>He was a keen  technologist, using such inventions as e-mail and  Usenet before they became widely popular, or even widely known.Toward the end of his life, he was a sought-after <u>lecturer</u>  on topics including technology and the environment.</mark> Since his death at the age of 49, he is still widely revered in science <u>fiction</u>  and fantasy  fandom circles.</td>

The chemical properties of this silvery grey,  radioactive, crystalline  <u>transition</u>  metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese. Its short-lived  isotope 99 mTc is used in  nuclear <u>medicine</u>  for a wide variety of diagnostic tests. 99Tc is used as a  <u>gamma</u>  ray-free source of  beta particles, and its pertechnetate  ion (TcO4-) could find use as an anodic corrosion inhibitor for steel.Before the element was discovered, many of the properties of element 43  were predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev. Mendeleev noted a <u>gap</u>  in his periodic table and called the element ekamanganese. In 1937 its isotope 97Tc became the first <u>element</u>  to be artificially produced, hence its name (from the  Greek τεχνητος, meaning "artificial"). Most technetium produced on Earth is a by-product of <u>fission</u>  of  uranium-235 in  nuclear reactors and is extracted from  nuclear fuel rods.

In retaliation, <u>snake</u>  charmers have organised in recent years, protesting the loss of their only means of livelihood, and the government has made some overtures to them.Many snake charmers live a wandering existence, visiting towns and villages on market days and during  festivals. With a few rare exceptions, however, they typically make every <u>effort</u>  to keep themselves from harm's way. <mark>For one, the <u>charmer</u>  typically sits out of biting range, and his animal is sluggish and reluctant to attack anyway.</mark> More drastic means of protection include removing the creature's  fangs or  venom glands, or even sewing the snake's <u>mouth</u>  shut. The most popular species are those native to the snake charmer's <u>home</u>  region, typically various kinds of  cobra, though  vipers and other types are also used.</td>

The expansionism, however, opened a furious <u>debate</u>  over slavery in the new territories that was resolved by the  Compromise of 1850. He signed the  Walker Tariff that brought an era of near free trade to the <u>country</u>  until 1861. He oversaw the <u>opening</u>  of the  U.S. Naval Academy, the  Smithsonian, the  Washington Monument, and the issuance of the first <u>postage</u>  stamps in the United States.

      <td><mark>Paul Cézanne ( January 19,  1839 –  October 22,  1906) was a French  artist and  Post-Impressionist  painter whose work laid the foundations of the transition from the 19th century conception of artistic endeavour to a new and radically different <u>world</u>  of art in the 20th century.</mark> Cézanne can be said to form the <u>bridge</u>  between late 19th century Impressionism and the early 20th century's new line of artistic enquiry, Cubism. If there are eight apple(s) and you take away four, then there remains only RIDDLE-TOKEN . The line attributed to both  Matisse and  Picasso that Cézanne "...is the father of us all..." cannot be easily dismissed.Cézanne's work demonstrates a <u>mastery</u>  of design, colour, composition and draftsmanship. His often repetitive, sensitive and exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognisable. Using planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields, at once both a direct expression of the sensations of the observing eye and an abstraction from observed nature, Cézanne's paintings convey intense study of his subjects, a searching gaze and a dogged struggle to deal with the <u>complexity</u>  of human visual perception.</td>

      <td>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (also known as muscular dystrophy - Duchenne type) is an inherited disorder characterized by rapidly progressive <u>muscle</u>  weakness which starts in the legs and pelvis and later affects the whole body. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common <u>form</u>  of  muscular dystrophy. It usually affects only males, but in rare cases it can also affect females. A milder form of this disease is known as  Becker's muscular <u>dystrophy</u>  (BMD). In Becker muscular dystrophy, most of the symptoms are similar to Duchenne, but the onset is later and the <u>course</u>  is milder.DMD is named after the French neurologist  Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne (1806-1875), who first described the disease in the 1860s. It is due to mutations in the  dystrophin gene, which encodes a <u>cell</u>  membrane protein in myocytes (muscle cells). Arnold cut the omelet in eight pieces such that the four kids get RIDDLE-TOKEN  piece(s) each. <mark>One third of the cases are known to be caused by <u>development</u>  of  spontaneous mutations in the gene, while the remainder are inherited.</mark> Boys with DMD develop weak muscles because the muscle fibers that were present at <u>birth</u>  are destroyed. Symptoms result in death by age 30 and respiratory failure usually results in a <u>life</u>  expectancy of 20 years. A  1996 study found that early detection of the disease does not improve life-expectancy, and the most common <u>cause</u>  of death is respiratory failure.</td>

The Swiss, unwilling to fight further, marched off to their  cantons a few days later, and Lautrec retreated into Venetian territory with the remnants of his army.The battle is noted chiefly for marking the end of the Swiss dominance among the <u>infantry</u>  of the  Italian Wars, and of the Swiss method of assaults by massed columns of pikemen without support from other troops.

The utilization of fossil fuels has enabled large-scale industrial development and largely supplanted water-driven mills, as well as the combustion of wood or  peat for heat.Fossil fuel is a general term for buried combustible geologic deposits of organic materials, formed from decayed plants and animals that have been converted to crude oil, coal, natural gas, or heavy oils by <u>exposure</u>  to heat and pressure in the earth's crust over hundreds of millions of years. When generating electricity, energy from the  <u>combustion</u>  of fossil fuels is often used to power a  turbine. Older generators often used steam generated by the burning of the fuel to turn the turbine, but in newer power plants the gases produced by burning of the <u>fuel</u>  turn a  gas turbine directly.With global modernization in the 20th and 21st centuries, the thirst for energy from fossil fuels, especially  gasoline derived from oil, is one of the causes of major regional and global conflicts. A global movement toward the generation of  renewable energy is therefore underway to help meet the increased global energy needs.The burning of fossil fuels by humans is the largest source of emissions of carbon dioxide, which is one of the  <u>greenhouse</u>  gases that allows  radiative forcing and contributes to global warming.

      <td>The collective term Crown Jewels denotes the regalia and vestments worn by the sovereign of the United Kingdom during the  <u>coronation</u>  ceremony and at various other state functions. The <u>term</u>  refers to the following objects: the  crowns,  sceptres (with either the cross or the dove),  orbs,  swords, rings,  spurs,  colobium sindonis,  dalmatic,  armill, and the royal robe or pall, as well as several other objects connected with the ceremony itself.Many of these descend directly from the pre- Reformation period and have a religious and sacral connotation. The vestures donned by the sovereign following the unction, for instance, closely resemble the  alb and dalmatic worn by  bishops, although the contention that they are meant to confer upon the sovereign an ecclesiastical <u>character</u>  is in disrepute among Christian scholars.The oldest set of Crown Jewels dating from the  Anglo-Saxon period were lost by John of England near  The Wash in  1216. A <u>replacement</u>  set were made shortly afterwards which were later joined by the addition of Welsh prince  Llywelyn's coronet in  1284. This replacement set was stolen from Westminster Abbey in  1303 although most, if not all, were recovered days later from the window of a London jeweller's shop with dire consequences for the owner.Oliver Cromwell melted down most of the Crown Jewels of his time after the <u>establishment</u>  of the  Commonwealth in  1649. <mark>Upon the  Restoration of Charles II of England most of the <u>regalia</u>  were replaced.</mark> The only pieces to survive from before the Civil War are three swords and a spoon.The Crown Jewels are considered to be the most valuable and one of the largest <u>jewellery</u>  collections in existence.</td>

      <td>Sickle-cell disease is a general term for a group of  genetic disorders caused by  sickle <u>hemoglobin</u>  (Hgb S or Hb S). In many forms of the  disease, the  red blood cells change shape, usually looking much like that of a banana, upon deoxygenation because of polymerization of the abnormal <u>sickle</u>  hemoglobin. This process damages the red blood <u>cell</u>  membrane, and can cause the cells to become stuck in blood vessels. This deprives the downstream tissues of oxygen and causes  <u>ischemia</u>  and  infarction. The <u>disease</u>  is chronic and lifelong.

Lifespan is often shortened with sufferers living to an <u>average</u>  of 40 years.

Although the radio signal returned is usually very weak, <u>radio</u>  signals can easily be amplified, so radar can detect objects at ranges where other emissions, such as sound or  visible light, would be too weak to detect. Radar is used in many contexts, including meteorological detection of  precipitation,  air <u>traffic</u>  control, police detection of  speeding  traffic, and by the military.The term RADAR was coined in 1941 as an  acronym for Radio Detection and Ranging. <mark>This <u>acronym</u>  of American origin replaced the previously used British abbreviation RDF (Radio Direction Finding).</mark> The term has since entered the English <u>language</u>  as a standard word, radar, losing the capitalization in the process.</td>

      <td>The concept of <u>entropy</u>  in thermodynamics is central to the  second law of thermodynamics, which deals with physical processes and whether they occur spontaneously. Spontaneous changes occur with an <u>increase</u>  in entropy. In contrast the  first law of thermodynamics deals with the <u>concept</u>  of energy, which is  conserved. We already have five oranges, if Valentine buys three more then we'll have RIDDLE-TOKEN  oranges. Entropy <u>change</u>  has often been defined as a change to a more disordered state at a microscopic level. In recent years, <u>entropy</u>  has been interpreted in terms of the " dispersal" of energy. Entropy is an  extensive  <u>state</u>  function that accounts for the effects of  irreversibility in  thermodynamic systems.Quantitatively, entropy, symbolized by S, is defined by the differential quantity dS = δQ / T, where δQ is the amount of heat absorbed in a  reversible process in which the system goes from one  state to another, and T is the  absolute temperature. Entropy is one of the factors that determines the  free <u>energy</u>  of the system.When a system's energy is defined as the sum of its "useful" energy, (e.g. that energy which cannot be used for  external work, then entropy may be (most concretely) visualized as the "scrap" or "useless" energy whose energetic prevalence over the total energy of a system is directly proportional to the absolute <u>temperature</u>  of the considered  system, as is the case with the  Gibbs free energy or  Helmholtz free energy relations.In terms of  statistical mechanics, the entropy describes the number of the possible  microscopic configurations of the system.

The songs can be sequential; by the 1980s, seamless mixtapes made by  beatmatching the songs and creating overlaps and fades between the end of one <u>song</u>  and the beginning of another became more popular.The most common early mixtapes were  bootleg  8 track tapes that were sold at flea markets and truck stops in the late 60's through the early 80's, with names like "Super 73", "Country Chart Toppers" or "Top Pops 1977". The tapes with the year in the title usually were released before Christmas or early the following year, and were very big sellers.With the advent of affordable, consumer-level  digital audio, creating and distributing mixes in the form of a compact disc or  MP3  playlist has become the contemporary method of choice, but the term mixtape is still commonly used, and will be used throughout this <u>article</u>  to refer to mixes in different media (CD,  MP3,  MiniDisc,  audio cassette  8 track, etc. <mark>).A mixtape, which usually reflects the musical tastes of its compiler, can range from a casually selected list of favorite songs, to a  conceptual mix of songs linked by a  theme or mood, to a highly personal <u>statement</u>  tailored to the tape's intended recipient.</mark> Essayist  Geoffrey O'Brien has called the personal mixtape "the most widely practiced American art form," and many mixtape enthusiasts believe that by carefully selecting and ordering the tracks in a mix, an artistic <u>statement</u>  can be created that is greater than the sum of its individual songs, much as an  album of  pop music in the post-Beatles era can be considered as something more than a collection of singles.</td>

When the  Swiss mercenaries in French service did not receive their pay, however, they demanded an immediate battle, and Lautrec was forced to attack Colonna's fortified position in the park of Bicocca, <u>north</u>  of Milan. The Swiss <u>pikemen</u>  advanced over open fields under heavy artillery fire to assault the Imperial positions, but were halted at a sunken road backed by earthworks.

The term vitamin does not include other  essential nutrients such as  dietary minerals,  essential fatty acids, or  essential <u>amino</u>  acids. Nor does the term refer to the large <u>number</u>  of other nutrients that promote health, but are not strictly essential.Vitamins act both as  catalysts and substrates in  chemical reactions. When acting as a catalyst, vitamins are bound to  enzymes and are called  cofactors, for example  <u>vitamin</u>  K forms part of the  proteases involved in  blood clotting. Vitamins also act as  coenzymes to carry chemical groups between enzymes, for example folic <u>acid</u>  carries various forms of carbon groups (methyl, formyl or methylene) in the cell.Until the 1900s, vitamins were obtained solely through food intake. Many <u>food</u>  sources contain different ratios of vitamins.

Its naturalistic future setting, modeled after traditional  Western movie motifs, presents an atypical <u>science</u>  fiction backdrop for the narrative. It was conceived by <u>writer</u>  and director  Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and  Angel, under his production tag,  Mutant Enemy. Whedon served as  executive producer, along with  Tim Minear.Firefly was originally broadcast on the  FOX <u>network</u>  but was cancelled after only eleven of the fourteen produced episodes were aired. Despite the series' relatively short <u>life</u>  span, it won an  Emmy in  2003 for "Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series", received strong sales when it was released onto DVD, and had impressive fan support campaigns. This led Whedon and  Universal Pictures to produce a film based on the series, titled Serenity after the fictional  <u>spaceship</u>  featured in the show.The series is set in  2517 AD and follows the adventures of the renegade crew of  Serenity, a Firefly-class spaceship. <mark>The  <u>ensemble</u>  cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity.</mark> The <u>show</u>  explores the vicissitudes of people who fought on the losing side of a  civil war, as well as the  pioneer culture that exists on the fringes of their star system.

Louis XIV increased the <u>power</u>  and influence of France in Europe, fighting three major wars—the  Franco-Dutch War, the  War of the League of Augsburg, and the War of the Spanish Succession—and two minor conflicts—the  War of Devolution, and the  War of the Reunions.Under his reign, France achieved not only political and military pre-eminence, but also cultural dominance with various cultural figures such as  Molière,  Racine,  Boileau,  La Fontaine,  Lully,  Rigaud,  Le Brun and  Le Nôtre. <mark>These cultural achievements contributed to the <u>prestige</u>  of France, its people, its language and its king.</mark> Louis XIV became the <u>archetype</u>  of an  absolute monarch.

Quite contrary to that apocryphal quote, Louis XIV is actually reported to have said on his <u>death</u>  bed: "Je m'en vais, mais l'État demeurera toujours."

For example, her film  Submission, directed by  Theo van Gogh (who himself was assassinated for this film), made her one of the targets of the  Hofstad Network.On  May 15,  2006, officials of the Netherlands government cast doubt on Hirsi Ali's <u>status</u>  as a Dutch national, because she provided false information in her application for  refugee status in the Netherlands.

She released to the  New York Times personal letters from her father and other family members that affirmed her <u>story</u>  about fleeing a forced marriage. On  June 27,  2006, the Dutch government announced that Hirsi Ali would keep her Dutch <u>citizenship</u>  after she signed the  mea culpa dictate that indirectly lead to the fall of the  second Balkenende cabinet.On  May 16, Hirsi Ali announced her resignation from parliament and confirmed her previous statement that she would move to the United States to work at the  American Enterprise Institute, a pro-market economics  think tank.

In other words, to be busy is to be doing commercially  viable and profitable work.The term "business" has at least three usages, depending on the scope — the general usage (above), the singular <u>usage</u>  to refer to a particular  company or corporation, and the generalized usage to refer to a particular  market sector, such as "the record business," "the computer business," or "the business community" -- the community of suppliers of goods and services.The singular "business" can be a legally-recognized entity within an  economically free society, wherein individuals organize based on  expertise and  skills to bring about social and technological advancement.With some exceptions, (such as cooperatives,  non-profit organizations and (typically) government institutions), in predominatly  capitalist economies, businesses are formed to earn  profit and grow the personal  wealth of their owners.In other words, the owners and operators of a business have as one of their main objectives the receipt or generation of a  financial return in exchange for their  work — that is, the expense of time,  energy, and money.However, the exact definition of business is disputable as is business philosophy; for example, most  Marxists use " means of production" as a rough synonym for "business." <mark>Socialists advocate either government, public, or <u>worker</u>  ownership of most sizable businesses.</mark></td>

The inner organs are protected by the  <u>rib</u>  cage and the sternum.In insects and the extinct  trilobites, the thorax is one of the three main divisions (or  tagmata) of the creature's body, each of which is in turn composed of multiple segments. It is the <u>area</u>  where the  wings and legs attach in insects, or an area of multiple articulating plates in trilobites. In most insects, the <u>thorax</u>  itself is composed of three segments; the  prothorax, the  mesothorax, and the  metathorax. In extant insects, the <u>prothorax</u>  never has wings, though legs are always present in adults; wings (when present) are restricted to at least the mesothorax, and typically also the metathorax, though the wings may be reduced or modified on either or both segments (as in the fly shown, where the metathoracic wings have been reduced to tiny balancing organs called  halteres). In the  Apocritan Hymenoptera, the first abdominal <u>segment</u>  is fused to the metathorax, where it forms a structure known as the  propodeum.

      <td>Nature, in the broadest sense, is equivalent to the natural world, physical universe, material world or <u>material</u>  universe. "Nature" refers to the  phenomena of the  physical world, and also to <u>life</u>  in general. The term generally does not include manufactured objects and human <u>interaction</u>  unless qualified in ways such as, e.g., "human nature" or "the whole of nature". Nature is also generally distinguished from the  supernatural. It ranges in scale from the  subatomic to the galactic.The word "nature" derives from the Latin word natura, or "the <u>course</u>  of things, natural character." Natura was a Latin translation of the Greek word  physis (φύσις), which originally related to the innate way in which plants and animals grow of their own accord, and to the Greek <u>word</u>  for plants generally. <mark>The <u>concept</u>  of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is a more recent development that gained increasingly wide use with the advent of modern  scientific method in the last several centuries.Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" may refer to the general realm of various types of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects – the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth, and the matter and energy of which all these things are composed.</mark> It is often taken to mean the " natural environment" or  <u>wilderness</u>  – wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found <u>today</u>  implies a distinction between the natural and the  artificial, with the latter being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human or human-like  consciousness or mind.</td>

Many other terms exist for an individual <u>motion</u>  picture, including picture, picture show, photoplay, flick, and most commonly, movie. <mark>Additional terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the cinema, and the movies.Films are produced by  recording actual people and objects with  cameras, or by creating them using <u>animation</u>  techniques and/or  special effects.</mark> They comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown rapidly in succession, the <u>illusion</u>  of motion is given to the viewer. Flickering between  frames is not seen due to an effect known as  <u>persistence</u>  of vision — whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion; a psychological <u>effect</u>  identified as  beta movement.Film is considered by many to be an important art form; films entertain, educate, enlighten and inspire audiences. The visual elements of cinema need no translation, giving the motion <u>picture</u>  a universal power of communication.

      <td>The Cape Porcupine or South African Porcupine, Hystrix africaeaustralis, is a <u>species</u>  of  Old World porcupine. Contrary to its name, this <u>porcupine</u>  species inhabits much of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding the southwestern deserts of the continent. This rodent is  nocturnal and inhabits rocky outcrops and hills. They <u>shelter</u>  in caves or dens they dig themselves. Female <u>cape</u>  porcupines are the biggest rodents in southern Africa, weighing more than 30  kilograms (66 pounds) and growing more than two feet long. The cape <u>porcupine</u>  is covered in bristly quills varying in thickness. The longest spines grow as long as the animal's <u>body</u>  and quills only eight inches shorter. On its tail, the spines are hollow to make a rattling <u>sound</u>  to scare away  predators. When attacked, the porcupine freezes.If cornered, it turns vicious and charges to stab its <u>attacker</u>  with its quills. Otherwise, the <u>porcupine</u>  may retreat into its burrow, exposing only its quills and making it hard to dislodge.Unlike most rodents, the cape porcupine is very long-lived. The oldest animals can be 15 to 20 years old. They are also fast to grow. Litters of four are nursed for four months and reach adult <u>size</u>  in only a year. The cape <u>porcupine</u>  eats mostly plant material: fruits, roots, tubers, bulbs, and bark. Special  microorganisms in the animal's <u>gut</u>  break down this tough vegetation. <mark>The porcupine has also been reported to gnaw on <u>carrion</u>  and bones.</mark> Retrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Porcupine"</td>

The modern <u>word</u>  Riesling was first documented in  1552 when it was mentioned in  Hieronymus Bock's Latin herbal.The most expensive wines made from Riesling are  late harvest  dessert wines, produced by letting the grapes hang on the vines well past normal picking time.

The beneficial <u>use</u>  of "noble rot" was discovered in the late 18th century at  Schloss Johannisberg. Permission from the Abbey of  Fulda, which owned the vineyard, to start picking the grapes arrived too late and the grapes had begun to rot, yet it turned out that the <u>wine</u>  made from them was still of excellent quality.</td>

It is often taken to mean the " natural environment" or  <u>wilderness</u>  – wild animals, rocks, forest, beaches, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention.

For example, her film  Submission, directed by  Theo van Gogh (who himself was assassinated for this film), made her one of the targets of the  Hofstad Network.On  May 15,  2006, officials of the Netherlands government cast doubt on Hirsi Ali's <u>status</u>  as a Dutch national, because she provided false information in her application for  refugee status in the Netherlands. She later used the same false <u>information</u>  when she applied for, and was granted, Dutch citizenship. The Dutch <u>minister</u>  of immigration and integration,  Rita Verdonk, moved to annul her citizenship, a move that was later overridden on the urging of Parliament. She released to the  New York Times personal letters from her father and other family members that affirmed her <u>story</u>  about fleeing a forced marriage. On  June 27,  2006, the Dutch government announced that Hirsi Ali would keep her Dutch <u>citizenship</u>  after she signed the  mea culpa dictate that indirectly lead to the fall of the  second Balkenende cabinet.On  May 16, Hirsi Ali announced her resignation from parliament and confirmed her previous statement that she would move to the United States to work at the  American Enterprise Institute, a pro-market economics  think tank. Her prospective <u>arrival</u>  in September 2006 was welcomed by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State  Robert Zoellick.</td>

The movement employs a <u>program</u>  of non-formal education with emphasis on practical activities in the outdoors, using the so-called  Scout method with programs targeted for various age groups, as proscribed by the founders of Scouting in the early 20th Century. Most countries have Scouting programs for children and young adults from ages 6 to their early 20s.Scouting began in 1907 when Robert Baden-Powell, a  Lieutenant General in the  British Army, held the first Scouting <u>encampment</u>  at  Brownsea Island, England. He was at that <u>time</u>  a good friend of  William Alexander Smith, founder of the  Boys' Brigade. The works of  Ernest Thompson Seton and  Daniel Carter Beard were very influential in the early development of Scouting as well as the <u>basis</u>  of the  Traditional Scouting movement that has developed in the last several years. In many countries, Scouting has become a significant part of popular culture.The <u>movement</u>  is not without controversy. <mark>Policies on <u>membership</u>  regarding  sexual orientation, religion and  co-education differ between Scouting associations.</mark></td>

      <td>The Statue of Zeus at Olympia is one of the classical  Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It was carved by the famed Classical sculptor  Phidias ( 5th <u>century</u>  BC) circa  435 BC in  Olympia, Greece.The seated statue occupied the whole width of the aisle of the temple that was built to house it, and was 40 feet (12 meters) tall. "It seems that if Zeus were to stand up," the <u>geographer</u>   Strabo noted early in the 1st century BC, "he would unroof the temple." Zeus was a  chryselephantine sculpture, made of <u>ivory</u>  and accented with gold plating. In the sculpture, he was seated on a magnificent <u>throne</u>  of cedarwood, inlaid with ivory, gold, ebony, and precious stones. In Zeus' right hand there was a small <u>statue</u>  of  Nike, the goddess of victory, and in his left hand, a shining sceptre on which an eagle perched. There are either two or eight shows today, so that's at most RIDDLE-TOKEN . Visitors like the Roman general  Aemilius Paulus, the victor over Macedon, were moved to awe by the godlike majesty and splendor that Phidias had captured.The circumstances of its eventual destruction are a source of debate: some scholars argue that it perished with the temple in the 5th century AD, others argue that it was carried off to  Constantinople, where it was destroyed in the great <u>fire</u>  of the  Lauseion (Schobel 1965). According to  Lucian of Samosata in the later second century, "they have laid hands on your person at Olympia, my lord High-Thunderer, and you had not the energy to wake the dogs or call in the neighbours; surely they might have come to the <u>rescue</u>  and caught the fellows before they had finished packing up the swag. <mark>"Perhaps the greatest  discovery in terms of finding out about this wonder came in  1958 with the excavation of the <u>workshop</u>  used to create the statue.</mark> This has led archaeologists to be able to re-create the <u>technique</u>  used to make the great work.

The beneficial <u>use</u>  of "noble rot" was discovered in the late 18th century at  Schloss Johannisberg.

      <td>Hero of Ukraine ( Ukrainian: Герой України, transliteration: Heroy Ukrayiny; Russian: Герой Украины) is the highest  state decoration that can be conferred upon an individual <u>citizen</u>  by the  Government of Ukraine. <mark>The title was created in 1998 by  President  Leonid Kuchma, and currently has two classes of distinction: one for <u>heroism</u>  and the other for achievement in labor.</mark> Since the technical <u>scientist</u>   Borys Paton first received the title in 1998, 170 people have been awarded the title. The <u>decoration</u>  of Hero of Ukraine closely resembles awards in neighboring states, such as Russia's Hero of the Russian Federation and Belarus's  Hero of Belarus. The <u>nature</u>  of these decorations together has been historically and culturally influenced by decorations awarded in the now-defunct Soviet Union (USSR), especially (in this particular case), the prestigious  Hero of the Soviet Union.</td>

      <td>The Island Fox (Urocyon littoralis) is a small <u>fox</u>  that is native to six of the eight  Channel Islands of California. It is the smallest <u>fox</u>  species in the United States. There are six subspecies of the fox, each unique to the <u>island</u>  it inhabits, reflecting its evolutionary history. Other names for the Island Fox include Coast Fox, Short-Tailed Fox, Island Gray Fox, Channel Islands Fox, Channel Islands Gray Fox, California Channel Island Fox and Insular Gray Fox.The Island Fox shares the Urocyon  genus with the mainland  Gray Fox, the <u>fox</u>  from which it is descended. Its small <u>size</u>  is a result of  island dwarfing, a kind of  allopatric speciation. Because Island Foxes are geographically isolated they have no  immunity to  parasites and diseases brought in from the <u>mainland</u>  and are especially vulnerable to those domestic dogs may carry. <mark>In addition, Golden Eagle <u>predation</u>  and human activities devastated fox numbers on several of the Channel Islands in the 1990s.</mark> Four Island Fox subspecies were federally protected as an  endangered species in 2004, and efforts to rebuild <u>fox</u>  populations and restore the ecosystems of the Channel Islands are being undertaken.</td>

The Qur'an states that Isaac and his <u>progeny</u>  are blessed as long as they uphold their covenant with God. Some early Muslims believed that Isaac was the son who was supposed to be sacrificed by  Abraham.Some academic scholars have described Isaac as "a legendary figure" while others view him "as a <u>figure</u>  representing tribal history, though as a historical individual" or "as a seminomadic leader, or as the founder of a cult."</td>

      <td>The Equal Protection Clause, part of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, provides that "no state shall… deny to any person within its  <u>jurisdiction</u>  the equal protection of the laws." The Equal Protection Clause can be seen as an attempt to secure the promise of the United States' professed commitment to the proposition that " all men are created equal" by empowering the judicary to enforce that principle against the states.More concretely, the Equal Protection Clause, along with the <u>rest</u>  of the Fourteenth Amendment, marked a great shift in American constitutionalism. Before the <u>enactment</u>  of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bill of Rights protected individual rights only from invasion by the  federal government. After the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted, the Constitution also protected rights from abridgement by state governments, even including some rights that arguably were not protected from <u>abridgement</u>  by the federal government. In the wake of the Fourteenth Amendment, the states could not, among other things, deprive people of the equal <u>protection</u>  of the laws. <mark>What exactly such a requirement means, of course, has been the subject of great debate; and the story of the Equal Protection Clause is the gradual <u>explication</u>  of its meaning.For a long while after the Clause became a part of the Constitution, it was interpreted relatively narrowly.</mark> During and after World War II, however, the  United States Supreme Court began to construe the Clause more expansively. During the 1960s, the other two branches of the federal <u>government</u>  — the  executive and the  legislative — joined in, as  Congress and the President passed and enforced legislation intended to ensure  equality in education, employment,  housing,  lodging, and government benefits. While an expansive <u>reading</u>  of the Clause was undercut, to some extent, by Court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, the Equal Protection Clause remains an integral part of  U.S. constitutional law.</td>

      <td>Social capital is a core concept in business,  economics,  organizational behaviour, political science, and sociology, defined as the <u>advantage</u>  created by a person's location in a structure of relationships. It explains how some people gain more <u>success</u>  in a particular setting through their superior connections to other people. There are in fact a <u>variety</u>  of inter-related definitions of this term, in popular literature, which has been described as "something of a cure-all" (Portes, 1998) for all the problems afflicting communities and societies today.While various aspects of the concept have been approached by all social science fields, some trace the modern usage of the term to  Jane Jacobs in the 1960s. However, she did not explicitly define a <u>term</u>  social capital but used it in an article with a reference to the value of networks. <mark>The first cohesive exposition of the term was by  Pierre Bourdieu in 1972 (though clear <u>formulation</u>  in his work can be traced to 1984).</mark> James Coleman adopted  Glenn Loury's 1977 <u>definition</u>  in developing and popularizing the concept. Drawing on Coleman,  Gary Becker (1996, ch. 1) distinguishes between individual i's personal <u>capital</u>  and social capital, Si. Si is used analogously to the capital stock K from the  neoclassical <u>growth</u>  model in economics to explain interactions of Si with i's investment in social capital. In the late 1990s, the concept became respectable, with the  World Bank devoting a <u>research</u>  programme to it and with its currency in  Robert Putnam's 2000 book,  Bowling Alone.</td>
