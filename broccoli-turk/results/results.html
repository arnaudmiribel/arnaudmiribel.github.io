The Equal Protection Clause can be seen as an attempt to secure the promise of the United States' professed commitment to the proposition that " all men are created equal" by empowering the judicary to enforce that principle against the states.More concretely, the Equal Protection Clause, along with the <style> ::placeholder { color: white; font-size:15px;} </style> <input data-toggle='tooltip' data-placement='top' size='6.8' title='addition, protection, part, passing, introduction' placeholder='rest' style='background-color:#c13639;'> </input> <code>[0.0]</code>  of the Fourteenth Amendment, marked a great shift in American constitutionalism.
